# Skill Launch Cheatsheet

Use this page when you need to choose which ShipGlowz skill to launch and which mode argument changes the workflow.

## Default Rule

Start with `000-shipglowz <instruction>` when you want a non-technical first command. It answers pure conversational requests directly and routes real work to the right master or specialist skill. It uses a default only when the route is clear, low-risk, context-compatible, and verifiable.

Start with `001-sg-build` directly when you already know the request is a feature, code, site, or docs workstream that needs the build lifecycle.

Use a focused skill directly when you intentionally want one owner lane: checks, docs, browser proof, auth diagnosis, manual QA, production truth, audit, dependency posture, migration, or final ship.

## Numeric Skill Codes

ShipGlowz also maintains a numeric lookup for faster skill discovery without renaming skills. The canonical index is `skills/references/skill-code-index.md`.

Accepted lookup forms include `001`, `001-sg-build`, `001sfbuild`, and `001 sg-build`; all resolve through `000-shipglowz` to the canonical runtime skill name. The numeric code is a lookup aid, not a second public name.

Core codes:

| Code | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| `000` | `000-shipglowz` |
| `001` | `001-sg-build` |
| `002` | `002-sg-maintain` |
| `003` | `003-sg-bug` |
| `004` | `004-sg-deploy` |
| `005` | `005-sg-ship` |
| `006` | `006-sg-design` |
| `007` | `007-sg-content` |
| `008` | `008-sg-end-user` |
| `009` | `009-sg-skill-build` |

Family bands: `100-199` lifecycle/proof, `200-299` content/research/copy, `300-399` docs/context/support, `400-499` audit/quality/ops, `500-599` design/components, `600-699` data/activation, `700-799` pilotage/session, `800-899` conversation/transcript, `900-999` internal/meta.

## Runtime Invocation Note

Keep four roles separate:

- `302-sg-help` explains and routes.
- `000-shipglowz` routes or answers directly.
- The selected lifecycle or specialist skill owns execution.
- The runtime may invoke internal calls after interpreting the user request.

Practical rule by runtime:

- Codex or Claude-style runtime: type the visible skill name such as `000-shipglowz` or `001-sg-build`.
- OpenCode or KiloCode-style runtime: ask for the ShipGlowz skill in natural language or use the runtime skill picker.
- Internal calls such as `skill({ name: "shipglowz" })` are runtime implementation details, not manual commands to type.

Runtime-specific repo pages:

- [OpenCode](./opencode-shipflow.md)
- [KiloCode](./kilocode-shipflow.md)

## Named Profiles

Named profiles are an operator layer above skills.

- `skill` = execution owner
- `operator role` = decision contract
- `agent profile` = human-readable invocation such as `Victoire`, `Prudence`, `Ariane`, `Adhesion`, `SEO Specialist`, or `Tariq`

Use `%<Profile>` when you want the router and owner skill to keep the same execution contract while changing arbitration posture for the turn.

- `%Victoire` -> growth prioritization and leverage
- `%Prudence` -> risk surfacing and coherence challenge
- `%Ariane` -> phase structure, sequencing, and first-slice framing
- `%Adhesion` -> end-user trust, clarity, and friction review
- `%SEO-specialist` -> search intent, discoverability, and page coherence
- `%Tariq` -> acquisition-channel choice, tracking readiness, and traffic-to-landing fit

Keep `#<Tag>` separate. A tag such as `#Adhesion` or `#growth` is a focus cue, not a named profile activation.

Example:

```text
%Ariane update les docs internes et surface externes #Adhesion
```

Here, `Ariane` structures the work, `#Adhesion` keeps end-user clarity and friction visible, and `000-shipglowz` still chooses the owner skill.

Common documentation and governance focus tags:

- `#rules` -> reload the governed-project rule set
- `#docs` -> enforce strict documentation architecture, metadata, placement, and update discipline
- `#public-docs` -> bias toward public/editorial documentation surfaces
- `#internal-docs` -> bias toward internal technical and operator-facing documentation
- `#canon` -> bias toward the canonical source of truth
- `#owner` -> bias toward the owning artifact instead of duplicated surfaces

Example:

```text
000-shipglowz #docs #canon #internal-docs audit this repo before we touch the docs
```

Here, `#docs` tightens documentation-governance compliance, `#canon` keeps the source of truth explicit, and `#internal-docs` biases the route toward internal governance artifacts rather than public copy.

## Current Runtime Families

Public categories make the catalog easier to browse. Runtime families explain how ShipGlowz routes work internally.

| Family | Role | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lifecycle/master | Carry work across several gates. | `000-shipglowz`, `001-sg-build`, `002-sg-maintain`, `004-sg-deploy`, `006-sg-design`, `007-sg-content`, `008-sg-end-user`, `009-sg-skill-build`, plus `100-sg-spec -> 101-sg-ready -> 102-sg-start -> 103-sg-verify -> 104-sg-end -> 005-sg-ship` |
| Data trust/source | Frame local-first data becoming account-backed cloud data and product access becoming entitlement-backed. | `600-sg-local-cloud-sync`, `601-sg-product-entitlements` |
| Audit/source | Expose quality, security, performance, SEO, copy, design, dependency, parity, or GTM risk that may deserve a chantier. | `400-sg-audit*`, `402-sg-deps`, `403-sg-perf`, `602-sg-platform-parity` |
| Bug/proof | Diagnose failures, validate behavior, or confirm deployment truth. | `003-sg-bug`, `106-sg-fix`, `107-sg-test`, `108-sg-browser`, `109-sg-auth-debug`, `405-sg-prod`, `105-sg-check`, `404-sg-migrate` |
| Content/docs/support | Keep public content, documentation, scaffolding, changelogs, skill contracts, governance surfaces, and git/GitHub hygiene coherent with shipped behavior. | `300-sg-docs`, `200-sg-redact`, `201-sg-enrich`, `202-sg-repurpose`, `304-sg-changelog`, `306-sg-scaffold`, `307-sg-skills-refresh`, `305-sg-init`, `310-sg-github-hygiene` |
| Research/pilotage/helper | Clarify information, prioritize, summarize, route, or preserve context without owning full lifecycle closure. | `203-sg-research`, `204-sg-market-study`, `205-sg-veille`, `701-sg-backlog`, `702-sg-priorities`, `703-sg-review`, `309-sg-tasks`, `301-sg-context`, `704-sg-model`, `302-sg-help`, `308-sg-status`, `303-sg-resume`, `700-sg-explore`, `707-name` |
| Internal/meta | Operator-only tools for maintaining ShipGlowz itself. | `900-shipglowz-core` |

## Master Skills

| Need | Launch | Useful modes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-technical first command | `000-shipglowz <instruction>` | Routes pure conversation directly; routes feature/code/docs to `001-sg-build`, maintenance to `002-sg-maintain`, bugs to `003-sg-bug`, release/deploy/prod proof to `004-sg-deploy`, content to `007-sg-content`, design to `006-sg-design`, onboarding to `008-sg-end-user`, local-to-cloud sync to `600-sg-local-cloud-sync`, skill maintenance to `009-sg-skill-build`, and obvious specialist audits to `400-sg-audit-*`. Uses context-safe defaults and asks one numbered question when ambiguity changes route, risk, scope, or proof. |
| Non-trivial product, code, site, or docs work | `001-sg-build [spark|codex|mini|agents|sous-agent|no-agents] <story, bug, or goal>` | Plain task text is the story. Use `spark`, `codex`, `mini`, `agents`, or `sous-agent` to make model-specific delegated sequential execution a validation gate. For user-facing features, `001-sg-build` evaluates whether to suggest or route `/008-sg-end-user` after implementation. Use detailed report modes only for handoff evidence. |
| Recurring project upkeep | `002-sg-maintain [mode]` | `full`/no argument, `quick`, `security`, `deps`, `docs`, `audits`, `no-ship`, `global`. |
| Release confidence after implementation | `004-sg-deploy [target or mode]` | no argument, `skip-check`, `--preview`, `--prod`, `no-changelog`. |
| Bug-loop lifecycle | `003-sg-bug [BUG-ID, summary, or mode]` | no argument, `BUG-ID`, `--fix`, `--retest`, `--verify`, `--ship`, `--close`. |
| Content management | `007-sg-content [goal, source, file, or mode]` | `plan`, `repurpose`, `draft`, `enrich`, `audit`, `seo`, `editorial`, `apply`, `ship`; add `score`, `quality gate`, or `grille projet` when you want project-aware scoring through the shared rubric. |
| Conversation quality audit | `705-sg-conversation-audit [latest|path <file-or-dir>|export shipflow|report=agent]` | Audit recurring operator-facing defects in conversation transcripts and route durable owner actions. |
| Design lifecycle | `006-sg-design <design question or goal>` | `tokens`, `audit`, `playground`, page/route targets, redesign goals, token migration, visual proof, or natural-language design requests. |
| End-user experience | `008-sg-end-user <feature, flow, screen, or audit target>` | UX/UI clarity, friction, trust, first-success paths, setup order, recoverable states, docs impact, and proof routing. |
| Local-to-cloud data sync | `600-sg-local-cloud-sync <project, feature, or data domains>` | Local data promotion, cloud hydration, merge/conflict policy, sync/save UX states, sensitive-data exclusions, and proof routing. |
| Product entitlements and access gates | `601-sg-product-entitlements <project or feature>` | Entitlement ownership, provider events, activation codes, product-local mirrors, backend authorization gates, support flows, and sync handoffs. |
| Skill creation or maintenance | `009-sg-skill-build <idea or path>` | new skill idea, existing skill path, optional `700-sg-explore` for fuzzy placement, public page/docs/runtime validation gates. |

If the request concerns declared products, sales surfaces, or evidence-backed claims, start by checking `shipglowz_data/business/product.md`, `shipglowz_data/business/gtm.md`, and `shipglowz_data/editorial/README.md` before launching a content or docs skill.

Content scoring examples:

```text
/007-sg-content audit article avec grille projet
/200-sg-redact finalise puis note ce brouillon
/202-sg-repurpose transforme cette source en article et applique la grille qualite
/103-sg-verify verifier le gate de score editorial
```

## Supporting Skills

| Need | Launch | Useful modes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manual expert lifecycle | `100-sg-spec -> 101-sg-ready -> 102-sg-start -> 103-sg-verify -> 104-sg-end` | Use when you intentionally want to drive each gate instead of using `001-sg-build`. |
| Commit and push ready work | `005-sg-ship [mode]` | no special argument, `skip-check`, `end la tache`/`end`/`fin`/`close task`, `all-dirty`/`ship-all`/`tout-dirty`. |
| Browser proof | `108-sg-browser` | Target a non-auth URL, route, preview, or production page. |
| Auth or session diagnosis | `109-sg-auth-debug` | Target login, OAuth, cookies, callbacks, tenants, providers, sessions, or protected routes. |
| Manual QA or retest evidence | `107-sg-test` | Target a guided scenario, checklist-first manual proof, test log, retest, or bug file update. |
| Deployment truth | `405-sg-prod` | Target deployment URL, build logs, runtime logs, preview/prod health, or live readiness. |
| Technical checks | `105-sg-check` | Target typecheck, lint, build, tests, dependency checks, or shell validation. |
| Documentation work | `300-sg-docs [mode or target]` | `readme`, `api`, `components`, `audit`, `update`, `metadata`, `technical`, `editorial`, or a file path. |
| Git/GitHub hygiene | `310-sg-github-hygiene [mode]` | `audit`, `branches`, `dependabot`, `fix`, plus current-repo or workspace scope. |
| Audit lane | `400-sg-audit*` | Choose the audit owner: code, design, copy, SEO, GTM, deps, perf, a11y, translation, components, or design tokens. |
| Platform parity/concordance | `602-sg-platform-parity <project, feature, or spec path>` | Check product and technical parity across web, Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux; route gaps to `100-sg-spec`, `001-sg-build`, `107-sg-test`, `103-sg-verify`, `300-sg-docs`, or `005-sg-ship`. |
| Conversation quality lane | `705-sg-conversation-audit` | Classify recurring conversation execution defects and route concrete owner follow-up paths. |
| Internal ShipGlowz Core audit | `900-shipglowz-core` | Operator-only execution-fidelity and plugin-packaging readiness audit for ShipGlowz itself; not a public user-plugin surface. |
| Design system creation | `500-sg-design-from-scratch [target or mode]` | Use when no coherent professional token system exists; modes include `tokens-only` and `with-playground`. |
| Dependency posture | `402-sg-deps` | Target dependency drift, vulnerabilities, licenses, or config. |
| Framework migration | `404-sg-migrate [package[@version]]` | Use a structured package target such as `astro@5`, a package name, or no argument for discovery. |
| Orientation and routing | `308-sg-status`, `302-sg-help`, `704-sg-model`, `303-sg-resume` | Use for git dashboard, workflow help, model choice, or concise context transfer. |

Model routing note: `704-sg-model` recommends the right model for the current scope. In Codex/OpenAI, default small bounded subagents to `gpt-5.4-mini`, use `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` for Spark-eligible summaries, text-only handoffs, micro-code, or targeted UI/local edits when credits/availability permit, route long implementation through the `codex` implementation profile, and use `gpt-5.5` with calibrated `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh` reasoning for high-risk transverse reasoning. The main thread may only recommend a model switch unless the runtime supports applying the override; `spark`, `codex`, `sous-agent`/`subagent`/`agents`, and `mini` arguments request model-specific subagent delegation.

## Explicit Mode Switches

| `407-sg-audit-translate` | no special argument; file path or scope; `global`; `sync`; `apply`; `sync [path]`; `apply [path]` |

## How To Read Arguments

An argument can be one of three things:

| Argument type | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mode keyword | A word or flag switches the workflow. | `002-sg-maintain quick`, `004-sg-deploy skip-check`, `005-sg-ship all-dirty` |
| Structured input | The shape of the argument selects a target. | `404-sg-migrate astro@5`, `003-sg-bug BUG-2026-05-03-001` |
| Free-form task | The argument is the actual work description. | `001-sg-build add a markdown skill cheatsheet` |

When in doubt, read the skill's `argument-hint` and mode-detection section. If no mode rule matches, treat the argument as a task or target description.

## Shell Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Expands to | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ch` | `clear; tmux clear-history` | Clear the current shell screen and the current tmux pane scrollback. |
