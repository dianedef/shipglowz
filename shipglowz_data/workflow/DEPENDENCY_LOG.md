# ShipFlow Dependency Ledger

Append-only machine-readable events for dependency audits, fix passes, and migrations.

## Parser Contract

- Events are fenced YAML blocks wrapped by `<!-- shipglowz:event start -->` and `<!-- shipglowz:event end -->`.
- Keep audit summaries in `AUDIT_LOG.md`; this file stores event evidence.
- Append only through `/home/claude/shipglowz/tools/append_shipglowz_event.py`.
- Empty ledger is valid.

## Events
