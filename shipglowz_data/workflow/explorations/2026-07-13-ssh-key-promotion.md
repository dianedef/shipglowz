# Exploration Report: Password-To-SSH-Key Promotion

## Starting Question

Can ShipGlowz use an initial password-authenticated connection to install an SSH public key on a newly paired server, then continue tunnels and remote operations without repeated password prompts?

## Context Read

- `CLAUDE.md` - established the server CLI and local tunnel architecture.
- `shipglowz_data/technical/context.md` - identified `local/local.sh` as the owner of local SSH UX.
- `shipglowz_data/technical/context-function-tree.md` - confirmed the connection-management flow and documentation ownership.
- `shipglowz_data/technical/code-docs-map.md` - identified required validation and documentation updates for `local/**` changes.
- `local/local.sh` - confirmed password/key selection, connection testing, and saved connection records already exist.
- `local/remote-helpers.sh` - confirmed auth-specific OpenSSH arguments and password-session reuse already exist.
- `local/install.sh` and `local/install_local.ps1` - confirmed local installation currently configures access but does not provision a remote public key.
- `local/README.md` and `local/README_WINDOWS.md` - confirmed public-key installation remains a manual documented step.

## Internet Research

No internet research was needed. The proposed flow relies on standard OpenSSH client and server behavior already used by the repository.

## Problem Framing

A new server may initially allow password authentication. ShipGlowz can already retain that connection through an OpenSSH control socket for eight hours, but the saved connection remains password-based. The missing capability is a safe, recoverable promotion from password authentication to key authentication without handling or storing the password itself.

The trust boundary must remain local-first: the private key is created or selected on the operator's local device, and only its public key is sent to the selected remote account.

## Option Space

### Option A: Use `ssh-copy-id` Directly

- Summary: invoke `ssh-copy-id -i <public-key> <target>` after the password connection succeeds.
- Pros: standard utility, handles common `authorized_keys` setup details, compact implementation.
- Cons: not consistently available on Windows and some minimal local systems; needs a fallback and controlled SSH arguments to match the selected ShipGlowz connection.

### Option B: Install The Public Key Through Existing SSH Helpers

- Summary: read a validated local `.pub` file and send it through the existing authenticated SSH connection to an idempotent remote command that creates `~/.ssh`, locks permissions, and appends only when absent.
- Pros: portable across systems with OpenSSH, reuses ShipGlowz auth and connection state, allows precise validation and error reporting.
- Cons: shell quoting and line validation must be rigorous; the implementation owns correct permissions and deduplication.

### Option C: Let The Server Generate And Return A Key Pair

- Summary: generate the identity on the server and transfer the private key to the local device.
- Pros: superficially centralizes setup.
- Cons: breaks the private-key trust boundary, creates unnecessary secret transfer and retention risk, and makes ownership ambiguous.

## Comparison

Option B is the strongest default because it works with the existing password-authenticated control connection and can be implemented consistently for Linux, macOS, WSL, Git Bash, and PowerShell. Option A is suitable as an optional fast path where `ssh-copy-id` exists, but it should not define the product contract. Option C should not be implemented.

## Emerging Recommendation

Add a local operation named `Installer une clé SSH sur ce serveur` with two entry points:

- immediately after a password-authenticated server is successfully added;
- in the saved-connection management menu for an existing password connection.

The operation should:

1. Offer an existing local key or generate a dedicated Ed25519 key, preferably `~/.ssh/shipglowz_<safe-host-id>`.
2. Never overwrite an existing private key and never print or transfer private-key content.
3. Validate that the public key is one supported single-line OpenSSH public key record.
4. Use the current password-authenticated connection to create remote `~/.ssh` with mode `700` and `authorized_keys` with mode `600` under the connected remote user.
5. Add the public key idempotently without replacing existing authorized keys.
6. Test a fresh key-only connection with password and keyboard-interactive authentication explicitly disabled.
7. Update `current_auth_method`, `current_identity_file`, and the saved connection record only after that fresh test succeeds.
8. Leave password authentication policy on the server unchanged. Disabling password login is a separate hardening action and must never be implicit in pairing.

## Non-Decisions

- Whether generated keys should use a passphrase by default.
- Whether `ssh-copy-id` should be used as an optional implementation optimization.
- Whether Windows PowerShell receives the feature in the first implementation or immediately after the Bash path.
- Whether an explicit key-removal or rotation UX belongs in the same initial scope.

## Rejected Paths

- Server-generated private key copied back to the client - violates the intended secret boundary.
- Replacing `authorized_keys` - could lock out existing devices and destroy unrelated access.
- Automatically disabling SSH password authentication - may lock out the operator and changes machine-wide security policy beyond pairing scope.
- Marking the connection as key-authenticated before an independent key-only test - creates a recoverability failure if provisioning was incomplete.

## Risks And Unknowns

- The remote account may have a nonstandard home directory, restricted shell, read-only filesystem, or managed `AuthorizedKeysCommand` policy.
- Root and regular-user accounts require different operational caution; the key must always be installed for the account in the selected SSH target.
- Public-key parsing must reject multiline input, options supplied by an untrusted source, private-key material, and shell metacharacter injection paths.
- A local private key may be unencrypted. The UX must explain the passphrase tradeoff without silently choosing weak protection.
- Existing OpenSSH multiplexed password sessions can make a test appear successful unless the verification explicitly uses a separate control path and disables password fallback.
- Host-key replacement during server migration must remain explicit; `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` does not accept a changed key, which is the safe behavior.

## Redaction Review

- Reviewed: yes
- Sensitive inputs seen: none
- Redactions applied: none
- Notes: No server address, password, private key, public key, token, or customer data was persisted.

## Decision Inputs For Spec

- User story seed: As an operator pairing a new ShipGlowz server with a local device, I can authenticate once by password, install a local public key safely, verify key-only access, and continue using tunnels without password prompts.
- Scope in seed: Bash local menu, reusable helper functions, idempotent remote public-key installation, fresh key-only verification, saved connection promotion, tests, and local SSH documentation.
- Scope out seed: SSH daemon reconfiguration, password-login disabling, firewall changes, private-key synchronization between devices, and automatic removal of old keys.
- Invariants/constraints seed: private key never leaves the local device; existing `authorized_keys` entries are preserved; state changes only after independent verification; failures leave password mode recoverable.
- Validation seed: shell syntax checks, focused helper tests with isolated HOME and fake SSH, idempotency test, failed-verification rollback test, duplicate-key test, and a real new-server migration smoke test.

## Handoff

- Recommended next command: `/107-sg-test password-to-ssh-key-promotion on the new server`
- Why this next step: completed on 2026-07-13 through the linked spec and implementation; the remaining gate is real-server manual proof via `/107-sg-test password-to-ssh-key-promotion`.
