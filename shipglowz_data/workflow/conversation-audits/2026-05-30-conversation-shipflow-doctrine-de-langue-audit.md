# Conversation Audit

## Context

- Source transcript: `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/conversation-shipflow-doctrine-de-langue-20260530-203004.md`
- Audit mode: `export shipflow`
- Audit scope: current tmux pane, captured with `tmux-capture-conversation --preset shipflow --yes`
- Reviewed at: `2026-05-30 20:30:20 UTC`
- Transcript length: `3029` lines

## Redaction / Safety Gate

- Unsafe-content detected: `true`
- Unsafe findings: terminal transcript contains local filesystem paths and command output context.
- Evidence redacted for public report: full transcript and raw path-heavy snippets are not copied here.
- Block reason: no public publication. Private governance storage is acceptable under `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/` and `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversation-audits/`.

## Deterministic Classifier Pass

Command:

```bash
python3 tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/conversation-shipflow-doctrine-de-langue-20260530-203004.md --fixtures
```

Classifier output:

- `unsafe_detected`: `true`
- `finding_count`: `2`
- categories: `bad_question`, `weak_follow_through`
- owner routes: `sg-build`

## Findings

No actionable agent-behavior finding retained.

| category | severity | title | confidence | evidence | owner | route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bad_question | low | Classifier false positive on product-decision text inside a diff | high | line 626, repeated around line 852 | none | no action |
| weak_follow_through | low | Classifier false positive on `TODO` inside an `rg` search command | high | lines 741, 891, 935 | none | no action |

## Aggregate Signals

- affected categories: `bad_question`, `weak_follow_through`
- most repeated issue: classifier context sensitivity on terminal transcripts
- owner concentration: no owner route retained after review
- evidence quality: medium for classifier regression insight, low for operational agent defect

## Routing

- recommended_action: `noop`
- recommended_chantier: none
- suggested next command: none

## Notes

- The export path worked.
- The report path worked.
- The current deterministic classifier is sensitive to command text and diffs. This is already an expected limitation from prior audits and does not justify a new chantier by itself.
- If repeated false positives become noisy, route a focused improvement to `sg-verify` or `sg-skill-build` for contextual classifier filtering.

## Next Step

- None for this transcript.
