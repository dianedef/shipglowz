# Conversation Audit

## Context

- Source transcript: interactive Codex session context, not exported as a standalone transcript file
- Audit mode: `report=agent`
- Audit scope: `300-sg-docs` behavior during ContentGlowz monorepo doc migration
- Reviewed at: `2026-06-29 18:59:25 UTC`
- cleaned_input_used: `true`

## Redaction / Safety Gate

- Unsafe-content detected: `false`
- Unsafe findings: `none`
- Evidence redacted for public report: `none`
- Block reason (if any): ``

## Findings

| category | severity | title | confidence | evidence | owner | route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stale_skill_contract` | high | Migration contract enforced canonical destination but not semantic preservation | high | User had to say that documentation should all live in `Shipflow Data`, then a later lab pass recovered durable backend/API/runtime content that had not been preserved in the first pass. | `300-sg-docs` | Harden migration doctrine and playbooks with preservation-first gates. |
| `weak_follow_through` | high | No mandatory consolidation audit after slimming local docs into facades | high | After facade conversion, the user asked for a lab consolidation pass to verify important documentation and task-planning content had not simply been deleted. | `300-sg-docs` | Require source-to-canonical preservation audit when local docs are slimmed or removed. |
| `user_friction` | medium | User had to restate the monorepo single-source contract | high | User message: local documentation still existed and the established contract was one durable source under `Shipflow Data`, scoped by `app/site/lab`. | `300-sg-docs` | Make compatibility-facade exceptions explicit and subordinate to canonical preservation rules. |
| `proof_gap` | medium | Existing validation proved structure and frontmatter, not preservation of meaning | high | Metadata lint and symlink checks passed, but they did not catch missing runtime/API sections and task-planning items until a manual recovery pass. | `103-sg-verify` | Add migration-specific proof expectations to `300-sg-docs` validation. |

## Aggregate Signals

- affected categories: `["stale_skill_contract", "weak_follow_through", "user_friction", "proof_gap"]`
- most repeated issue: `facade-first migration without preservation proof`
- owner concentration: `{"300-sg-docs": 3, "103-sg-verify": 1}`
- evidence quality: high

## Routing

- recommended_action: `reroute`
- recommended_chantier: `300-sg-docs migration-preservation hardening`
- suggested next command: `edit /home/claude/shipflow/skills/300-sg-docs/SKILL.md and references to require preservation-ledger and consolidation proof`
- shipflow_core_followup: `run`
- shipflow_core_followup_result: `python3 /home/claude/shipflow/tools/audit_shipflow_skills.py returned no generic execution-fidelity findings, so the gap is specific to 300-sg-docs contract coverage rather than broad skill packaging failures.`

## Next Step

- `Patch 300-sg-docs local contract, core governance reference, and mode playbooks to require semantic preservation before facade/deletion and to require consolidation proof after migration.`
