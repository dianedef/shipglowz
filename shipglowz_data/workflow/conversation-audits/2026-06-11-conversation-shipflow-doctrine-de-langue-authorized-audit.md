# Conversation Audit

## Context

- Source transcript: `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/conversation-shipflow-doctrine-de-langue-20260530-203004.md`
- Audit mode: `default`, latest non-fixture transcript
- Audit scope: `sg-spec -> sg-ready -> sg-start -> sg-verify` on SocialGlowz processor-agnostic LTD commerce
- Reviewed at: `2026-06-11 09:10:00 UTC`
- cleaned_input_used: `yes`
- raw_line_count: `3029`
- cleaned_line_count: `1868`
- Operator override: local paths may be read as private evidence. Raw transcript excerpts remain redacted/minimized in this report.

## Redaction / Safety Gate

- Unsafe-content detected by helper: `true`
- Operator override applied: `yes`, for local path evidence only.
- Unsafe findings: repeated local absolute paths in raw transcript.
- Evidence redacted for report: exact local path values beyond canonical source references; no secrets are printed.
- Block reason: none after operator override.

The transcript contains local paths and security vocabulary, but this pass did not identify a real exposed secret token in the checked patterns.

## Findings

| category | severity | title | confidence | evidence | owner | route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| over_reporting | medium | User-mode reports exposed more detail than the operator needed | high | `sg-ready` included detailed official-doc URL evidence after already giving the readiness verdict. | 001-sg-build | Keep successful user reports to verdict, proof summary, material limits, and one next step; keep matrices in durable artifacts or `report=agent`. |
| proof_gap | medium | Hosted proof gap was named but not turned into an executable owner route | high | `sg-verify` ended partial with missing Lemon Squeezy/Convex/refund proof, but the next action stayed broad instead of naming a precise proof owner and scenario. | 103-sg-verify | Partial verification should include `proof_type`, owner skill, scenario, and target/environment when hosted proof is missing. |
| weak_follow_through | low | Completion wording competed with open proof gaps | medium | `sg-start` said local implementation was complete and the objective was closed while hosted/provider proof remained pending. | 001-sg-build | Use "local implementation complete, hosted proof pending" wording until the lifecycle gate is actually closed. |

## Aggregate Signals

- affected categories: `over_reporting`, `proof_gap`, `weak_follow_through`
- most repeated issue: lifecycle state was mostly accurate, but the final user-facing shape made proof ownership less explicit than it should be.
- owner concentration: `{ "001-sg-build": 2, "103-sg-verify": 1 }`
- evidence quality: high
- cleaned_input_used: `yes`
- shipflow_core_followup: `run`; local ShipFlow Core skill audit returned 0 hard findings, 0 review findings, 0 style findings across 66 skills.

## Current Contract Coverage

No immediate skill rewrite is recommended from this audit.

The conversation is older than the current hardened contracts. The current `reporting-contract.md` already constrains successful user reports, and `spec-driven-development-discipline.md` now requires hosted proof follow-through fields for partial verification. The plugin audit found no current execution-fidelity gap.

## Routing

- recommended_action: `noop`
- recommended_chantier: `none`
- suggested next command: `/103-sg-verify conversation-audit-current-contract-coverage` only if an additional independent review is desired.

## Chantier potentiel

Chantier potentiel: non
Raison: the historical issues are already covered by current ShipFlow reporting/proof contracts, and the plugin follow-through found no current skill-contract finding.

## Next Step

- No new chantier required from this audit.
