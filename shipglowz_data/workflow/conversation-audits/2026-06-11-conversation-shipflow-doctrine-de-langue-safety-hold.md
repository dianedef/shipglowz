# Conversation Audit Safety Hold

## Context

- Source transcript: `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/conversation-shipflow-doctrine-de-langue-20260530-203004.md`
- Audit mode: `default`, latest non-fixture transcript
- Audit scope: ShipFlow conversation audit rerun
- Reviewed at: `2026-06-11 09:09:22 UTC`
- cleaned_input_used: `yes`
- raw_line_count: `3029`
- cleaned_line_count: `1868`

## Redaction / Safety Gate

- Unsafe-content detected: `true`
- Unsafe findings: local absolute paths are present repeatedly in the raw transcript.
- Evidence redacted for public report: all raw excerpts and exact path values beyond the source transcript path.
- Block reason: `705-sg-conversation-audit` requires a safety hold when a transcript contains likely private paths/log-path material.

The scan did not identify a real published secret token in the checked patterns. It did identify local filesystem paths, which are still private operational evidence and must not be quoted in a user-facing audit report.

## Findings

No behavioral findings are published from this run because the safety gate blocked raw-content output before evidence excerpts could be safely used.

| category | severity | title | confidence | evidence | owner | route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| unsafe_ship_or_dirty_scope | medium | Transcript needs redaction/hygiene before conversation findings can be republished | high | Redacted safety scan: repeated local absolute paths in raw transcript. | 100-sg-spec | Define a transcript redaction and hygiene contract, then rerun `705-sg-conversation-audit`. |

## Aggregate Signals

- affected categories: `unsafe_ship_or_dirty_scope`
- most repeated issue: raw transcript contains private local path material.
- owner concentration: `{ "100-sg-spec": 1 }`
- evidence quality: high for safety hold; conversation-behavior findings not evaluated for publication.
- cleaned_input_used: `yes`
- shipflow_core_followup: `skipped` because no skill-contract finding category was published after the safety hold.

## Routing

- recommended_action: `create-spec`
- recommended_chantier: `ShipFlow conversation transcript redaction and hygiene`
- suggested next command: `/100-sg-spec ShipFlow conversation transcript redaction and hygiene`

## Chantier potentiel

Chantier potentiel: oui
Titre propose: ShipFlow conversation transcript redaction and hygiene
Raison: `705-sg-conversation-audit` cannot safely republish transcript evidence while raw captured conversations retain private local paths.
Severite: P2
Scope: transcript capture, cleaner/classifier safety rules, audit report redaction policy.
Evidence:
- `unsafe_detected=true` from the local conversation audit helper.
- Repeated local absolute paths detected by targeted safety scan.
Spec recommandee: `/100-sg-spec ShipFlow conversation transcript redaction and hygiene`
Prochaine etape: `/100-sg-spec ShipFlow conversation transcript redaction and hygiene`

## Next Step

- `/100-sg-spec ShipFlow conversation transcript redaction and hygiene`
