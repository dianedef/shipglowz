# Conversation Audit

## Context

- Source transcript: `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/conversation-shipflow-doctrine-de-langue-20260530-203004.md`
- Audit mode: `default`, latest canonical transcript
- Audit scope: transcript-title fidelity versus dominant conversation scope
- Reviewed at: `2026-06-19 00:00:00 UTC`
- cleaned_input_used: `yes`
- raw_line_count: `3029`
- cleaned_line_count: `1868`

## Redaction / Safety Gate

- Unsafe-content detected by helper: `true`
- Unsafe findings: repeated local absolute paths in the raw transcript
- Evidence redacted for report: exact local path values beyond canonical ShipFlow references
- Block reason: none, private governance storage only

## Findings

| category | severity | title | confidence | evidence | owner | route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stale_skill_contract | medium | Transcript title no longer reflects the dominant captured scope | high | The stored transcript is titled `Conversation ShipFlow - doctrine de langue`, but the cleaned body is dominated by `sg-spec -> sg-ready -> sg-start -> sg-verify` work for SocialGlowz processor-agnostic LTD commerce, and the current capture script still contains a hard-coded `doctrine de langue` title shortcut before it tries to infer from the prompt. | 100-sg-spec | Harden transcript-title inference so stored ShipFlow conversations prefer the dominant active scope or latest explicit prompt over stale keyword matches in the pane history. |

## Aggregate Signals

- affected categories: `stale_skill_contract`
- most repeated issue: naming fidelity, not execution quality
- owner concentration: `{ "100-sg-spec": 1 }`
- evidence quality: high
- cleaned_input_used: `yes`
- shipflow_core_followup: `run`; local ShipFlow Core skill audit found no hard findings, with one unrelated review note on `skills/101-sg-ready/SKILL.md` body size.

## Current Contract Coverage

The earlier reporting/proof findings for this transcript are already covered by current ShipFlow contracts and previous audits.

What remains uncovered is the transcript naming rule itself: current capture behavior can preserve or re-infer an outdated title that no longer matches the dominant conversation scope, which weakens later retrieval and audit trust.

## Routing

- recommended_action: `create-spec`
- recommended_chantier: `transcript-title-inference-dominant-scope`
- suggested next command: `/100-sg-spec transcript-title-inference-dominant-scope`

## Chantier potentiel

Chantier potentiel: oui
Titre propose: `transcript-title-inference-dominant-scope`
Raison: a private governance transcript should stay findable and semantically trustworthy; stale title inference degrades auditability and future reuse.

## Next Step

- `/100-sg-spec transcript-title-inference-dominant-scope`
