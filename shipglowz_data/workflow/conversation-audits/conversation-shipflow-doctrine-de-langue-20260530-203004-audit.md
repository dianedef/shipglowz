# Conversation Audit

## Context

- Source transcript: `/home/claude/shipflow/shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/conversation-shipflow-doctrine-de-langue-20260530-203004.md`
- Audit mode: `default` with fallback to latest non-fixture ShipFlow transcript
- Audit scope: `sg-spec -> sg-ready -> sg-start -> sg-verify` on SocialGlowz processor-agnostic LTD commerce
- Reviewed at: `2026-06-10 07:54:09 UTC`
- cleaned_input_used: `yes`; terminal chrome, long diffs, raw command output, and bulk spec content were treated as classifier noise unless tied to an agent/user turn.

## Redaction / Safety Gate

- Unsafe-content detected: `false`
- Unsafe findings: `none`
- Evidence redacted for public report: `none`
- Block reason: ``
- Note: raw transcript contains sensitive-word matches such as environment variable names and auth/security contract vocabulary, but no secret values were included in this audit report.

## Findings

| category | severity | title | confidence | evidence | owner | route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| over_reporting | medium | User-mode reports exposed too much internal evidence detail | high | `sg-ready` final listed multiple official Lemon Squeezy URLs and dense lifecycle evidence after already giving the readiness verdict. | sg-build | Tighten successful user-mode reports to outcome, proof summary, limits, and one next action; keep URL matrices in `report=agent` or durable artifacts. |
| proof_gap | medium | Hosted proof route stayed descriptive instead of executable | high | `sg-verify` ended partial with "config Lemon Squeezy test-mode, smoke checkout/webhook/refund, preuve hosted Convex..." but did not convert that into a concrete owner route such as `sg-prod`, `sg-test`, or a named smoke checklist step. | sg-verify | When verification is partial due hosted proof, route the next proof owner and exact scenario, not just the missing evidence nouns. |
| weak_follow_through | low | Completion wording competed with open proof gaps | medium | `sg-start` reported "implémenté et validé localement" and "objectif suivi clôturé" while the same report still listed no real Lemon Squeezy smoke and no hosted Convex/refund/replay proof. | sg-build | Prefer "local implementation complete, production proof pending" and avoid closure-sounding phrasing until the current lifecycle gate is actually closed. |

## Aggregate Signals

- affected categories: `over_reporting`, `proof_gap`, `weak_follow_through`
- most repeated issue: proof and lifecycle state were mostly accurate, but the user-facing report shape made the next action heavier than necessary.
- owner concentration: `{ "sg-build": 2, "sg-verify": 1 }`
- evidence quality: high

## Positive Signals

- The lifecycle stayed spec-first and readiness-aware.
- The agent checked official provider docs before payment/webhook decisions.
- The requested GPT-5.3 Codex Spark subagent was actually used for `sg-start`.
- `sg-verify` correctly refused to call the work ship-ready without hosted provider proof.
- Metadata lint and checklist status were used to catch durable artifact quality issues.

## Routing

- recommended_action: `create-spec`
- recommended_chantier: `ShipFlow hosted-proof follow-through and user-report discipline`
- suggested next command: `/sg-spec shipflow hosted-proof follow-through and user-report discipline`

## Chantier potentiel

Chantier potentiel: oui
Titre propose: ShipFlow hosted-proof follow-through and user-report discipline
Raison: The audit found a recurring lifecycle/reporting quality gap across successful and partial skill reports: user-mode reports overexpose evidence while partial verification lacks a concrete proof-owner handoff.
Severite: P2
Scope: `sg-build`, `sg-verify`, reporting contract pressure scenarios, proof-owner routing language.
Evidence:
- `sg-ready` user report included detailed external-doc URL matrices.
- `sg-verify` partial report named missing hosted proof but not a concrete proof-owner route.
- `sg-start` used closure-sounding wording despite explicit hosted proof gaps.
Spec recommandee: `/sg-spec shipflow hosted-proof follow-through and user-report discipline`
Prochaine etape: `/sg-spec shipflow hosted-proof follow-through and user-report discipline`

## Next Step

- `/sg-spec shipflow hosted-proof follow-through and user-report discipline`
