# Conversation Audit

## Context

- Source transcript: current chat context, not an exported stored transcript.
- Audit mode: direct current-conversation audit requested by operator.
- Audit scope: why the agent stopped after `sg-start` instead of continuing to `sg-verify` or testing further itself.
- Reviewed at: `2026-06-10 19:32:33 UTC`
- cleaned_input_used: yes, command outputs and patch details were treated as classifier noise except where they proved validation.

## Redaction / Safety Gate

- Unsafe-content detected: `false`
- Unsafe findings: `none`
- Evidence redacted for public report: `none`
- Block reason: ``

## Findings

| category | severity | title | confidence | evidence | owner | route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| weak_follow_through | medium | `sg-start` stopped at its lifecycle boundary even though the next proof step was local and non-destructive | high | Final report said `Prochaine etape: /sg-verify ...` rather than running it. | sg-build | Clarify when orchestration should use `sg-build` or auto-continue through local verification. |
| user_friction | medium | The report made the operator issue another lifecycle command to discover whether all findings were truly closed | high | User immediately asked why the agent stopped instead of continuing/testing itself. | sg-build | Prefer a next-owner route that explains `sg-start` vs `sg-build`, or add a safe auto-follow-through rule. |
| stale_skill_contract | medium | The current contracts do not clearly bridge `sg-start implemented` to automatic `sg-verify` when verification is purely local | medium | `sg-start` says implementation can be `implemented` while verification remains pending; `sg-build` owns full orchestration. Neither says whether `sg-start` may auto-run `sg-verify` for local-only skill-governance work. | sg-spec | Create a spec to define auto-follow-through semantics for local-only verification. |
| proof_gap | low | No `sg-verify` run was performed, but local mechanical tests were performed | high | Checks run: plugin audit 0 findings, budget audit 0 risks, metadata lint OK, diff check OK, sync check OK. | sg-verify | Run `/sg-verify Residual ShipFlow Skill Body Risk Cleanup` if a separate lifecycle verdict is still required. |
| literalism_over_intent | low | The agent followed the literal `sg-start` boundary instead of inferring the operator wanted full lifecycle continuation | medium | User used `$sg-start`, not `$sg-build`, but later expected continued testing. | sg-build | Make the command boundary more visible in user-facing reports. |

## Why The Agent Stopped

The immediate cause was the skill boundary, not a lack of local tests.

`sg-start` is an implementation skill. Its contract allows `implemented` when planned edits and checks inside `sg-start` scope are complete, and it explicitly routes remaining verification to `sg-verify`. In this conversation the agent followed that contract: it compacted the skills, ran the required local checks, updated the chantier trace, and reported `/sg-verify ...` as the next lifecycle step.

The operator expectation was broader: after a clean local validation surface, the agent should either continue into `sg-verify` itself or explain that only `sg-build` owns the full `start -> verify -> end -> ship` lifecycle. The report did not make that distinction explicit enough.

## Aggregate Signals

- affected categories: `weak_follow_through`, `user_friction`, `stale_skill_contract`, `proof_gap`, `literalism_over_intent`
- most repeated issue: lifecycle boundary ambiguity
- owner concentration: `{sg-build: 3, sg-spec: 1, sg-verify: 1}`
- evidence quality: high
- shipflow_core_followup: run
- shipflow_core_followup_result: `python3 ~/plugins/shipflow-core/scripts/audit_shipflow_skills.py` reported 66 skills, 0 hard findings, 0 review findings, 0 style findings.

## Routing

- recommended_action: `create-spec`
- recommended_chantier: `Auto-follow-through for local-only sg-start verification`
- suggested next command: `/sg-spec Auto-follow-through for local-only sg-start verification`

## Chantier Potentiel

Chantier potentiel: oui
Titre propose: Auto-follow-through for local-only sg-start verification
Raison: The current lifecycle split is coherent internally but creates operator friction after local-only `sg-start` runs where `sg-verify` can be executed safely by the agent.
Severite: P2
Scope: `skills/sg-start/SKILL.md`, `skills/sg-build/SKILL.md`, `skills/references/master-workflow-lifecycle.md`, reporting guidance for lifecycle next steps.
Evidence:
- User asked why the agent stopped after a clean `sg-start` implementation.
- `sg-start` report routed to `/sg-verify` instead of continuing.
- Plugin audit found no mechanical skill finding, so this is a workflow contract gap rather than a syntax/body-quality issue.
Spec recommandee: `/sg-spec Auto-follow-through for local-only sg-start verification`
Prochaine etape: `/sg-spec Auto-follow-through for local-only sg-start verification`

## Next Step

- `/sg-spec Auto-follow-through for local-only sg-start verification`
