# Project Import Checklist

## Before Start

- [ ] URL or repo is available
- [ ] Source type is known or can be resolved quickly
- [ ] Private memory root is available at `~/.shipglowz/private/data/`

## Import

- [ ] Identify source type
- [ ] Check for existing project fiche
- [ ] Check for existing pitch or governed truth
- [ ] Extract stable project facts
- [ ] Write or update `projects/<project-slug>.md`
- [ ] Keep private material out of Git
- [ ] Record uncertainty and provenance

## After Import

- [ ] Decide whether downstream routing is needed
- [ ] Route to `emailing`, `007-sg-content repurpose <source>`, `300-sg-docs`, `203-sg-research`, `009-sg-marketing market`, or `205-sg-veille` if applicable
- [ ] Confirm the file remains short and reviewable

## Update Pass

- [ ] Compare the current source against the existing private file
- [ ] Refresh the pitch if the project has evolved
- [ ] Update the business angle if it is materially different
- [ ] Update routing tags and owner skill candidate if needed
- [ ] Record what changed since the previous version
- [ ] Preserve old claims only when they still hold

## Completion Rule

This checklist is complete only when one private project file exists or has been refreshed, and no private source material has been written to a public repository.
