# Repo Documentation Governance Refresh Phase 2

## Purpose

Record the ownership decisions, consumer evidence, preservation status, and remaining migration debt for the root documentation pass. This audit is the durable checklist for `DOC-ROOT-01` through `DOC-ROOT-07`.

## Execution Contract

- Proof path: `evidence-first`.
- Root inventory command: `find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' -printf '%f\\n' | sort`; this includes regular files and compatibility symlinks.
- Consumer search: `rg -n '<filename-or-stem>' --glob '!node_modules/**' --glob '!.git/**' --glob '!shipglowz-site/.astro/**' .`.
- Mutation rule: no source file is reduced or deleted unless its non-redundant content is preserved in a named canonical target and the diff is reviewed.
- Worktree rule: files already modified before this run are not rewritten without a file-specific review.

## Root Inventory And Decisions

| Root artifact | Family | Consumers found | Canonical target | Verdict | Preservation / action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENT.md` | entrypoint | README, technical maps, agent workflows | root entrypoint | `keep-root` | Canonical agent entrypoint; no mutation. |
| `AGENTS.md` | compatibility | agent tooling convention | `AGENT.md` | `compat-facade` | Valid symlink to `AGENT.md`; preserve as compatibility alias. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | bootstrap/instructions | agent runtime | root instructions | `keep-root` | Tool-native entrypoint; no migration. |
| `README.md` | public/operator surface | broad repository links | root README | `keep-root` | Public/operator overview; existing worktree modification treated as pre-existing. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | public history | release readers | root changelog | `keep-root` | Public project changelog; no migration. |

## Top-Level Documentary Surfaces

| Surface | Contract role | Verdict | Action / proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `shipglowz_data/` | canonical governance and workflow corpus | `keep-root` | Canonical owner. |
| `docs/` | legacy mixed documentation surface | `migrate-to-canonical` | Conversations moved to `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/`, explorations to `shipglowz_data/workflow/explorations/`, and operator guides to `shipglowz_data/technical/operator-guides/`; root directory removed. |
| `archive/` | legacy historical surface | `migrate-to-canonical` | Useful history moved to `shipglowz_data/workflow/archives/repository-history/`; conversations moved to `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/`; duplicate, generated, empty-facade, and scratch material deleted; root directory removed. |
| `bugs/` | legacy bug workflow surface | `migrate-to-canonical` | Dossiers moved to `shipglowz_data/workflow/bugs/`; root directory removed and producer contracts updated. |
| `specs/` | legacy governance source | `migrate-to-canonical` | `frp-preview-tunnel-poc.md` moved to `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/`; the empty source directory is removed. |
| `research/` | legacy governance source | `migrate-to-canonical` | Both research reports moved to `shipglowz_data/workflow/research/`; the empty source directory is removed. |
| `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/` | raw conversation capture output | `canonical` | Explicit destination contract in `800-tmux-capture-conversation`; downstream cleaned/audited records may separately live under `shipglowz_data/workflow/`. |
| `shipglowz_data/workflow/explorations/` | exploration report output | `canonical` | Explicit destination selected by the `700-sg-explore` contract. |

## Migrated And Archived Decisions

| Former root artifact | Final target | Verdict | Final proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `shipglowz-metadata-migration-guide.md` and legacy `shipflow-metadata-migration-guide.md` | `shipglowz_data/technical/metadata-migration-guide.md` | `migrate-to-canonical` | Root aliases are absent; README, AGENT, context, and code-docs map use the canonical path. |
| `shipglowz-spec-driven-workflow.md` and legacy `shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md` | `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md` | `migrate-to-canonical` | Root aliases are absent; README, AGENT, context, and code-docs map use the canonical path. |
| `ECOSYSTEM-AND-PORTS.md` | `shipglowz_data/technical/runtime-cli.md` plus `shipglowz_data/workflow/archives/repository-history/root-documentation/ECOSYSTEM-AND-PORTS.md` | `archived` | Current runtime route is in README; historical source is preserved inside the canonical archive corpus. |
| `FAQ.md` | `shipglowz_data/workflow/archives/repository-history/root-documentation/FAQ.md` | `archived` | Historical internal guidance is preserved separately from the site-owned public FAQ. |
| `INSTALL-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md` | `shipglowz_data/workflow/templates/INSTALL-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md` | `migrate-to-canonical` | Canonical template exists and the former root alias is absent. |
| `INSTALL-RUN-TRACE.md` | `shipglowz_data/workflow/audits/2026-04-28-install-run-trace.md` | `archived` | Historical trace exists at the dated canonical audit path and the former root alias is absent. |
| `INSTALLATION-OWNERSHIP-SPEC.md` | canonical workflow spec plus `shipglowz_data/workflow/archives/repository-history/root-documentation/` preservation | `archived` | Active references use the canonical spec; historical source remains canonically archived. |
| `TASKS.md` and `AUDIT_LOG.md` | `shipglowz_data/workflow/` | `archived` | Empty root facades are absent; canonical trackers remain active. |
| `concurrent.md` | `shipglowz_data/workflow/concurrent.md` | `archived` | Root facade is absent and the workflow note remains canonical. |
| `conversation-shipflow-questions-contextuelles-des-skills.md` | `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/` | `migrate-to-owned-surface` | Raw conversation capture moved to the destination owned by the conversation workflow. |

## Required Scenario Results

### DOC-ROOT-01

The direct root inventory is five Markdown paths: four regular files (`AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`) and one compatibility symlink (`AGENTS.md -> AGENT.md`). The top-level documentary-surface inventory separately classifies `shipglowz_data/` and the migrated legacy sources `archive/`, `bugs/`, `docs/`, `specs/`, and `research/`.

### DOC-ROOT-02

The four named phase-2 debts have explicit decisions and consumer evidence:

- `ECOSYSTEM-AND-PORTS.md`: current behavior is routed to `shipglowz_data/technical/runtime-cli.md`; historical content is archived and indexed.
- `FAQ.md`: historical internal guidance is archived without conflation with the site-owned public FAQ.
- `INSTALL-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md`: canonical workflow template exists under `shipglowz_data/workflow/templates/`; no root alias remains.
- `INSTALL-RUN-TRACE.md`: canonical historical evidence exists under the dated workflow audit path; no root alias remains.

### DOC-ROOT-03

The workflow artifacts are preserved under canonical workflow paths without root facades. `ECOSYSTEM-AND-PORTS.md` and `FAQ.md` are preserved under `shipglowz_data/workflow/archives/repository-history/root-documentation/`; current runtime documentation uses `shipglowz_data/technical/runtime-cli.md`. The archive migration ledger records every preserved or intentionally deleted source.

### DOC-ROOT-04

The later integrator pass updated `README.md`, `AGENT.md`, `shipglowz_data/technical/context.md`, and `shipglowz_data/technical/code-docs-map.md` to use canonical workflow and metadata-guide paths. The governance follow-up also aligned `architecture.md`, canonical-path rules, project/documentation governance rules, and the canonical repository-history index. README routes current port/PM2 behavior to `shipglowz_data/technical/runtime-cli.md` and historical context to `shipglowz_data/workflow/archives/`.

### DOC-ROOT-05

- `AGENTS.md` remains a symlink to `AGENT.md`.
- The audit, canonical install artifacts, README, AGENT, context, technical index, and code-docs map pass targeted ShipGlowz metadata validation.
- Former root paths for the four named phase-2 debts are absent; repository searches resolve surviving mentions to canonical or archive paths, historical audits, or explicit migration evidence.
- The unrelated worktree change in `skills/references/private-data-repo-contract.md` remains outside this verification and was not modified.

### DOC-ROOT-06

- Root `docs/` is absent.
- Conversation captures and exploration reports are under their canonical workflow families.
- OpenCode, KiloCode, focus-tag, and skill-launch guides are indexed under `shipglowz_data/technical/operator-guides/`.
- Capture scripts, tests, plugin bootstrap, README, and public-site links use the canonical paths; the deprecated `docs` capture preset resolves to the canonical conversation destination without recreating `docs/`.

### DOC-ROOT-07

- Root `bugs/`, `BUGS.md`, and `TEST_LOG.md` are absent.
- Bug dossiers, the bug triage view, and the QA log are preserved under `shipglowz_data/workflow/`.
- Bug, fix, test, verify, deploy, ship, and artifact-template contracts use canonical workflow paths.
- The topology audit and metadata guard reject recreation of the legacy root surfaces.

## Follow-up Actions

1. Keep `shipglowz_data/workflow/audits/2026-04-28-install-run-trace.md` historical; update only if future install evidence requires a new dated trace.
2. Completed: repaired the three stale test contracts. Config/logging/cache passes `25/25`, Flox provisioning passes `22/22`, and project tracking passes `15/15` with a new idempotence assertion.
3. Completed: audited the six root CLI compatibility launchers. `shipglowz.sh`, `lib.sh`, `config.sh`, and `install.sh` retain active compatibility consumers; the two unconsumed root `shipglowz_devserver_*` facades were removed and canonical `cli/` references were preserved.

## 103-sg-verify Follow-up Findings

- The phase-2 documentation scenarios pass: governance topology is compliant, all 12 topology tests pass, all 4 conversation-storage tests pass, metadata lint passes, and legacy documentary surfaces remain absent.
- Repository-root test placement debt was resolved by moving seven useful suites under ownership-based `tests/` subdirectories and replacing opaque priority names with behavior-based names.
- `tests/cli/config-logging-cache.sh` now uses canonical logging variables, fails closed on assertion errors, and passes `25/25`.
- `tests/cli/json-error-handling.sh` targets canonical `cli/lib.sh` instead of the root compatibility facade and passes `33/33`.
- `tests/runtime/flox-provisioning.sh` uses canonical override and session-name contracts and passes `22/22`.
- `tests/governance/project-tracking-init.sh` targets `shipglowz_init_project`, validates actual symlink removal, and passes `15/15`; `shipglowz_init_project` now returns success explicitly when no changes are needed.
- All seven relocated suites now pass, and the two unconsumed root devserver compatibility facades are absent.

## Stop Conditions Encountered

- The initial execution stopped on pre-existing modifications to shared central files; a later bounded integrator pass completed the canonical route updates.
- `ECOSYSTEM-AND-PORTS.md` required separation of current runtime truth from historical examples; current truth is canonical and the historical source is archived.
- `FAQ.md` could not safely become the public FAQ; archiving preserved it without creating a competing editorial source.

Preservation comparison against HEAD before migration:
4 conversation captures, 5 exploration reports, and 3 bug dossiers are byte-identical.
BUGS.md and TEST_LOG.md preserve their records with only canonical path substitutions.
The 4 operator guides preserve their bodies with migration metadata, canonical-path substitutions, and two repaired guide links.

Migration preservation diff:
The FRP spec body is unchanged; only migration metadata, the current skill identifier, and the previously missing required confidence field changed.
Both research report bodies are unchanged; only updated dates and current 203-sg-research identifiers changed.
Archive migration proof: 15 of 16 preserved historical files are byte-identical to their pre-migration blobs; `plan_migration.md` differs only by a final newline normalization. Two conversation captures were moved without content changes. Deleted compatibility symlinks resolve to canonical workflow artifacts; all other deletions are classified in the repository-history ledger.

Final root-architecture verification on 2026-07-13:
all seven ownership-based Bash suites pass (`25/25`, `68/68`, `33/33`, `15/15`, `22/22`, runtime sync, and `4/4` conversation storage); 12 topology unit tests pass; governance topology, Bash syntax, metadata lint, skill runtime sync `270/270`, and `git diff --check` pass; no root `test_*.sh` or root devserver facade remains.
