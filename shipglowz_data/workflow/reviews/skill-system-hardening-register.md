# Skill System Hardening Register

## Purpose

This register tracks the cross-skill hardening sweep requested on 2026-06-26.
The goal is not broad rewrite churn. The goal is to review every ShipFlow skill
against the same execution-fidelity pressure points and only open edits where
the risk is concrete.

## Review Contract

Audit each skill against these five checks:

1. `preflight`: does the skill force a mechanical preflight before fragile
   validation or external tooling?
2. `canonical_paths`: does it resolve ShipFlow-owned tools and references from
   `${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-$HOME/shipglowz}` rather than the project cwd?
3. `system_loop`: does the skill help convert a miss into `problem -> cause ->
   prevention -> contract improvement`, instead of only reporting the symptom?
4. `operator_last_resort`: does the skill avoid pushing proof back to the
   operator when the agent can run it safely?
5. `body_size`: is the activation body compact enough that critical gates stay
   visible under pressure?

## Status Legend

- `todo`: not yet reviewed against this register
- `verify`: a likely good pattern exists and needs a focused mechanical check
- `priority`: known risk already observed or flagged by audit
- `done`: reviewed against this register and no immediate hardening needed

## Sweep Outcome

| Area | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Shared doctrine | Repetition was reduced by extracting `shipflow-owned-preflight.md`, `operator-last-resort-evidence.md`, `preview-proof-routing.md`, and reusing `chantier-tracking.md` for chantier-potential thresholds. |
| High-risk execution skills | `101`-`109`, `003`, and `405` now expose first-screen guardrails more reliably with local anchors to shared doctrine. |
| Remaining corpus | Mechanical and targeted review found no additional immediate contract hole beyond `emailing`, which now exposes the reporting contract explicitly. |
| Residual system risk | The main remaining issue is corpus-wide aggregate body size (`8581 / 8500`), which is a compaction campaign, not an execution-fidelity contract gap. |

## Hardening Snapshot

| Skill | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `900-shipflow-core` | strong baseline | Explicit canonical preflight, explicit system-improvement loop, and explicit stop condition for running ShipFlow-owned audit steps too early. |
| `101-sg-ready` | compacted | Detailed review heuristics and report templates moved to a local playbook; the activation body is now compact enough to clear the body-size risk. |
| `102-sg-start` | hardened | Added a compact local ShipFlow-owned preflight so canonical reference/tool resolution and operator-last-resort discipline stay visible in the activation body. |
| `103-sg-verify` | hardened | Added a compact local ShipFlow-owned preflight so verification cannot start from inferred paths or partial reference memory under pressure. |
| `108-sg-browser` | reference pattern | Best current example of explicit runtime preflight, safe stop behavior, and owner routing before browser proof. |
| `emailing` | patched | Added explicit `Report Modes` so the audit tool no longer sees a hidden reporting contract on this lightweight master workflow. |

## Update Rule

When a skill is reviewed, update its row with:

- `status`
- one short `current signal`
- one concrete `next action` or `none`

Do not rewrite the register into essay form. Keep it as the operational sweep
tracker for this hardening campaign.
