evidence:
  - "`503-sg-audit-design-tokens` now keeps the activation contract compact and loads the deep audit detail from a local reference."
  - "`skill_budget_audit.py` reports `8364 / 8500`, so the aggregate activation-budget target is met."
  - "`audit_shipflow_skills.py` and metadata/runtime checks pass for the bounded phase-1 closure slice."

# Aggregate Skill Corpus Compaction Phase 1 Review

## Verdict

The bounded phase-1 compaction target is complete.

## What holds

- The deep design-tokens audit detail no longer competes with the first-screen activation contract in `503-sg-audit-design-tokens`.
- The aggregate skill corpus is back under the `8500` activation-budget ceiling.
- No extra discovery-description trim was needed in this closure run because the broader corpus cleanup had already reduced the aggregate listing cost.

## Residual note

Future compaction work, if any, should be framed as a new phase only when another aggregate overage or new body-risk signal appears.
