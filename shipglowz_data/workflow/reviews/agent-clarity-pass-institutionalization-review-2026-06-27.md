  - "The playbook captures the bounded future method, first-screen clarity contract, batching rules, validation loop, and after-action capture."
  - "The checklist turns the method into a reusable execution artifact for a future clarity pass."
  - "A transversal dedup check already removed one duplicate taxonomy bullet before closure, which validates the need for the final review step in the playbook."

# Agent Clarity Institutionalization Review

## Verdict

The institutionalization slice is complete.

## What holds

- Future clarity passes now have one explicit method and one reusable checklist instead of relying on session memory.
- The captured doctrine stays distinct from the separate aggregate compaction campaign, which prevents future scope drift.
- The final transversal dedup step proved useful and is now part of the durable method.

## Residual limit

This slice does not reduce the global corpus budget. The remaining structural hardening topic is aggregate compaction, tracked separately.
