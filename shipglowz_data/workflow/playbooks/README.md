# Workflow Playbooks

`shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/` is the canonical library for reusable operational playbooks that can apply across multiple projects, sites, apps, or business surfaces.

Use this folder when the document answers:

- `how should we run this domain end-to-end?`
- `in what order should we execute the work?`
- `what inputs, decisions, outputs, and gates exist?`

## What Belongs Here

- transversal launch playbooks
- SEO, GTM, onboarding, release, migration, and growth playbooks
- domain operating sequences reused across multiple projects
- shared playbooks that one or more project-local checklists can instantiate
- `seo-charge-referencement-web-playbook.md`

## What Does Not Belong Here

- project-specific task trackers
- one-off audit reports
- manual test execution checklists with PASS/FAIL rows
- durable business or technical truth that belongs in `shipglowz_data/business/` or `shipglowz_data/technical/`

## Playbook Contract

Every canonical playbook should make these sections easy to find:

1. `Purpose`
2. `Applicability`
3. `Inputs`
4. `Execution Order`
5. `Decision Gates`
6. `Outputs`
7. `Linked Checklists`
8. `Failure Modes` or `Common Risks`

## Naming Rule

Use domain-first kebab-case names:

- `site-launch-playbook.md`
- `seo-launch-playbook.md`
- `content-refresh-playbook.md`
- `app-store-release-playbook.md`

## Relationship With Checklists

- `playbook` = operating method
- `checklist` = execution control surface

A playbook explains how the domain should run. A checklist proves whether a concrete run or project has completed the required steps.

## Layering Rule

When both are needed:

1. keep the shared reusable method here under `playbooks/`
2. keep the paired reusable checklist under `../checklists/`
3. keep project-run evidence under `../test-checklists/` only when it is an executed proof artifact

## Migration Rule

If a reusable playbook exists at the repository root or inside an ad hoc folder, migrate it here unless there is a stronger canonical location already declared.

Keep a short migration note in the final report when:

- the source path was legacy
- the filename changed
- the content was split into shared playbook plus checklist

## First Targets

The current architecture expects this folder to absorb shared documents such as:

- `site-launch-playbook.md`
- future `seo-launch-playbook.md`
- future `distribution-launch-playbook.md`
- future `app-release-playbook.md`
- `seo-charge-referencement-web-playbook.md`

## Validation

```bash
python3 /home/claude/shipflow/tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py /home/claude/shipflow/shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/README.md
```
