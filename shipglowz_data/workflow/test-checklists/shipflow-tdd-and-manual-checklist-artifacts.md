| Scenario ID | Surface | Scenario | Required | Expected | Status | Observed | Evidence pointer | Notes | Bug Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S001 | skill-governance | checklist semantics are operator-filled and machine-readable | yes | required rows are PASS and evidence pointer is safe | PASS | helper confirms syntax and required PASS rows | test-evidence/shipflow-tdd-and-manual-checklist-artifacts/checklist-semantics.json | operator-facing checklist is clean and non-blocking for this scope | |
| S002 | skill-governance | optional parser sample: explicit alias normalization case | no | parser fixture case remains documented for regression checks | NOT_RUN | not executed in operator pass | test-evidence/shipflow-tdd-and-manual-checklist-artifacts/parser-fixture-note.md | parser behavior is covered by dedicated fixture file | |
| S003 | skill-governance | optional parser sample: edge status path exists in dedicated fixture | no | fixture-only status examples are non-blocking for operator flow | NOT_RUN | dedicated fixture contains FAIL/BLOCKED/NOT_RUN examples | test-evidence/shipflow-tdd-and-manual-checklist-artifacts/parser-fixture.md | see parser fixture file for required status semantics | |
