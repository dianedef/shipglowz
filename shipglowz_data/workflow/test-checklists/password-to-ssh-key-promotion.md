# Manual Test Checklist: Password-To-SSH-Key Promotion

Use a redacted server label such as `new-server`; do not record a hostname, password, public-key record, private-key path, IP address, or raw SSH output.

| Scenario ID | Surface | Scenario | Required | Expected | Status | Observed | Evidence pointer | Notes | Bug Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SSHKEY-M01 | local SSH menu | Add the new server with password auth, accept promotion, and generate or select a per-device key | yes | Public key installs, independent key-only proof passes, and saved mode becomes `key` | PASS | Tooling observed password setup, dedicated key generation, `installed`, independent key-only success, and saved `key` mode | shipglowz_data/workflow/TEST_LOG.md | 2026-07-13 20:37:47 UTC; target label `qa-server` | |
| SSHKEY-M02 | remote authorized keys | Run `Installer une clé SSH sur ce serveur` again with the same identity | yes | Operation reports the key as present and does not add a duplicate blob | PASS | Repeated menu action reported `present`; each tested public blob occurred exactly once | shipglowz_data/workflow/TEST_LOG.md | 2026-07-13 20:37:47 UTC; no key content retained | |
| SSHKEY-M03 | Android Termux SSH session | Close the password ControlMaster, restart `urls`, and start one app tunnel from Termux | yes | Tunnel starts without a server-password prompt | NOT_RUN | Android Termux device proof not yet run | None | Linux integration proof passed on the retained QA server; do not record socket paths or host data | |
| SSHKEY-M04 | remote authorized keys | Confirm pre-existing authorized keys still authenticate after promotion | yes | Existing device access remains valid and file modes are restrictive | PASS | First identity still authenticated after second promotion; remote modes were `700` and `600` | shipglowz_data/workflow/TEST_LOG.md | 2026-07-13 20:37:47 UTC; no key lines recorded | |
| SSHKEY-M05 | second local device | Install a distinct public key from another device | yes | Both devices authenticate independently; no private key is copied | PASS | A second isolated local home generated a distinct identity; both identities authenticated independently and coexisted | shipglowz_data/workflow/TEST_LOG.md | 2026-07-13 20:37:47 UTC; physical Android proof remains M03 | |
