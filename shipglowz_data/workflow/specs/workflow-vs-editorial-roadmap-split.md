# Spec: Workflow vs Editorial Roadmap Split

## Title

Workflow vs Editorial Roadmap Split

## Status

Ready.

## User Story

En tant qu'operatrice ShipGlowz qui pilote a la fois du travail technique et du contenu public, je veux un registre editorial distinct du backlog d'execution, afin que les skills ne melangent plus implementation technique et opportunites de contenu.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

`shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md` becomes the execution tracker for technical or implementation work. Public-content, repurposing, editorial, copy, SEO-content, FAQ, docs-publics, and audience-email follow-ups live in a separate operational artifact at `shipglowz_data/editorial/ROADMAP.md`. Skills that currently write content follow-ups to `TASKS.md` must instead route those records to the editorial roadmap, while mixed outputs split technical records and editorial records into the appropriate files.

## Success Behavior

- A canonical editorial operational tracker exists under `shipglowz_data/editorial/ROADMAP.md`.
- Shared doctrine explains when to write to `workflow/TASKS.md` versus `editorial/ROADMAP.md`.
- `205-sg-veille`, `206-sg-audit-copy`, `207-sg-audit-copywriting`, and `406-sg-seo` load the shared routing rule before tracker writes.
- `309-sg-tasks` keeps explicit ownership of execution trackers and does not claim the editorial roadmap as its default domain.
- Current ShipGlowz tracker state no longer keeps the split decision as an open todo.

## Error Behavior

- If a content surface is undeclared, report `surface missing` instead of creating an editorial roadmap item that implies the surface exists.
- If one finding spans both technical execution and editorial follow-up, create paired records in both trackers instead of collapsing them into one ambiguous task.
- If the target tracker anchor is ambiguous after authoritative re-read, stop and ask rather than forcing a rewrite.

## Scope In

- Create `shipglowz_data/editorial/ROADMAP.md`.
- Create one shared tracker-routing reference for execution vs editorial writes.
- Update the relevant content and audit skills to use that routing rule.
- Update the editorial and runtime doctrine docs that describe the new artifact.
- Update the current ShipGlowz tracker item that requested this split.

## Scope Out

- Migrate historical editorial tasks from every external project repository.
- Create a new lifecycle master skill for editorial planning.
- Replace chantier specs as the source of truth for non-trivial content work.
- Add frontmatter to operational trackers.

## Constraints

- `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/` remains the chantier registry.
- Operational trackers stay plain Markdown without ShipGlowz metadata frontmatter.
- The editorial roadmap must stay operational, not become a second governance corpus.
- Shared routing doctrine should live in a reusable reference first; local skill wording should only narrow it.

## Invariants

- Technical implementation backlog remains in `shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md`.
- Editorial/public-content backlog remains in `shipglowz_data/editorial/ROADMAP.md`.
- Specs remain the source of truth for non-trivial chantiers.
- A content task does not become technical just because it is discovered during an audit.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Create the shared routing contract and the editorial roadmap artifact.
- [x] Task 2: Rewire content and audit skills that currently write content follow-ups into `workflow/TASKS.md`.
- [x] Task 3: Update doctrine docs and close the open ShipGlowz tracker item.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: `shipglowz_data/editorial/ROADMAP.md` exists and is clearly operational.
- [x] AC2: a shared reference names the split between execution tracker and editorial roadmap.
- [x] AC3: the affected skills and workflow references mention the new routing rule.
- [x] AC4: `shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md` no longer keeps the split as an open todo.

## Test Strategy

- Metadata lint for changed governed docs and references.
- Skill budget audit after skill/reference changes.
- Focused `rg` checks for `ROADMAP.md`, `workflow/TASKS.md`, and the routing reference across affected skills.

|----------|-------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 2026-07-09 00:00:00 UTC | 100-sg-spec | GPT-5 Codex | Created the ready spec directly from the open tracker item and explicit operator request. | ready | /009-sg-skill-build workflow vs editorial roadmap split |
| 2026-07-09 00:00:00 UTC | 101-sg-ready | GPT-5 Codex | Confirmed the artifact path, impacted skills, routing doctrine, and validation surface are explicit. | ready | /009-sg-skill-build workflow vs editorial roadmap split |
| 2026-07-09 00:00:00 UTC | 009-sg-skill-build | GPT-5 Codex | Created the editorial roadmap artifact, added the shared tracker-routing contract, rewired affected skills, and updated doctrine. | implemented | /103-sg-verify workflow vs editorial roadmap split |
| 2026-07-09 16:10:55 UTC | 103-sg-verify | GPT-5 Codex | Verified metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime skill visibility checks, and focused routing grep checks for the tracker split. | verified | user review or bounded ship |
| 2026-07-11 00:00:00 UTC | 009-sg-skill-build | GPT-5 Codex | Added explicit `300-sg-docs` loading and playbook language so `update` and `editorial` modes recognize `shipglowz_data/editorial/ROADMAP.md` as the editorial backlog companion. | implemented | /103-sg-verify workflow vs editorial roadmap split |
| 2026-07-11 11:43:16 UTC | 103-sg-verify | GPT-5 Codex | Verified the explicit `300-sg-docs` routing update with metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime sync, and focused grep checks for `ROADMAP.md` in `update` and `editorial` playbooks. | verified | user review or bounded ship |
