# Spec: sg-conversation-audit cleaned transcript classification

## Title

sg-conversation-audit cleaned transcript classification

## Status

ready

## User Story

En tant qu'opératrice ShipGlowz, je veux que `sg-conversation-audit` classe une vue conversationnelle nettoyée plutôt que le bruit tmux brut, afin que les audits détectent les vrais travers agents sans faux positifs issus des commandes, diffs ou logs.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

`sg-conversation-audit` must preserve the raw tmux transcript as private evidence, derive a classifier input that removes or ignores non-conversational terminal blocks, command transcripts, diffs, JSON output, and long logs, then classify only the cleaned conversation text. The report must mention both source paths when a cleaned view is used and must not quote sensitive raw content. The easy edge case is to make the classifier less noisy by suppressing too much: the cleaned pass must still detect real agent-behavior failures from fixture conversations.

## Success Behavior

- Preconditions: a raw tmux/Codex transcript exists under `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/`, or an explicit path is provided.
- Trigger: the operator runs `$sg-conversation-audit latest`, `$sg-conversation-audit path <file>`, or `$sg-conversation-audit export shipflow`.
- User/operator result: the audit report is based on conversation turns, not shell/diff/log noise.
- System effect: the classifier can produce a cleaned-text view internally or as a private sidecar; it keeps raw transcript references for evidence and safety.
- Success proof: the previously captured transcript `conversation-shipflow-doctrine-de-langue-20260530-203004.md` no longer reports `bad_question` and `weak_follow_through` from diff/search-command noise, while the positive issue fixture still reports `missed_action`, `over_reporting`, `literalism_over_intent`, `bad_question`, and `user_friction`.
- Silent success: not allowed; reports must state whether a cleaned classifier input was used.

## Error Behavior

- Expected failures: missing transcript, unreadable file, cleaned view empty or too small, unsafe raw transcript content, or classifier input ambiguity.
- User/operator response: block only when no usable conversation text remains or redaction cannot be preserved safely.
- System effect: do not overwrite raw transcripts, do not publish raw paths/secrets, and do not turn classifier false positives into owner routes.
- Must never happen: delete private transcript evidence, quote raw secrets/logs in reports, or suppress real user/agent turns just because they mention command-like text.
- Silent failure: not allowed. If cleaning removes all meaningful content, report `blocked` with reason.

## Problem

ShipGlowz can only access conversation history reliably through tmux/Codex terminal capture. That source includes assistant commands, diffs, search output, JSON, file paths, and logs. The first real `export shipflow` audit proved the export path works but also showed deterministic classifier false positives from a product-decision sentence inside a diff and `TODO` inside an `rg` command. Without a cleaned classifier input, repeated audits will produce noise and erode trust.

## Solution

Add a conservative transcript-cleaning layer to `tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py` and wire `sg-conversation-audit` documentation to require classifying cleaned conversation text by default. Keep the raw transcript as evidence. Add regression fixtures that prove command/diff noise is ignored while real behavior failures remain detectable.

## Scope In

- Add cleaned-classification mode to `tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py`.
- Default the tool to cleaned classifier input while allowing raw mode for diagnostics if useful.
- Add or update fixtures for:
  - noisy tmux transcript false positives;
  - positive conversation failures that must remain detected.
- Update `skills/sg-conversation-audit/SKILL.md` so `export shipflow`, `latest`, and `path` classify the cleaned view.
- Validate metadata and skill runtime visibility if skill text changes.

## Scope Out

- No full replacement of `clean-conversation-transcript`.
- No public publication of cleaned/private transcripts.
- No LLM-based classifier in this pass.
- No broad rewrite of report templates unless needed for the cleaned-input field.
- No ship of unrelated dirty files.

## Constraints

- Raw transcript remains the private source of evidence.
- Cleaning must be conservative: remove obvious terminal/diff/log noise, not operator intent.
- A false positive removed from command/diff text is a success; a real user complaint removed from conversation text is a failure.
- The implementation must stay deterministic and testable.
- Existing dirty worktree changes must not be reverted.

## Test Contract

- `surface`: Python helper, sg-conversation-audit skill contract, private Markdown fixtures.
- `proof_profile`: regression-first plus metadata/static validation.
- `proof_order`:
  1. reproduce noisy transcript classification;
  2. implement cleaned classifier input;
  3. verify noisy transcript produces no false-positive findings;
  4. verify positive fixture still produces expected categories;
  5. metadata lint and focused rg checks;
  6. skill budget/sync if skill contract changes.
- `checklist_path`: none; no manual operator checklist is required for this deterministic workflow change.
- `required_scenario_ids`:
  - `NOISY-TMUX-DIFF`: diff lines and `rg` commands must not create `bad_question` or `weak_follow_through`.
  - `POSITIVE-FAILURES`: real conversation failure fixture must still produce known categories.
  - `RAW-SAFETY`: unsafe raw transcript flag remains visible even when cleaned classification is used.
  - `EMPTY-CLEANED`: if cleaned text is empty, the tool must not claim a clean audit silently.
- `required_results`:
  - The noisy transcript from the 2026-05-30 run returns zero retained categories in default cleaned mode.
  - The positive fixture still returns `missed_action`, `over_reporting`, `literalism_over_intent`, `bad_question`, and `user_friction`.
  - The tool output exposes whether cleaned input was used.
  - `sg-conversation-audit` documentation tells agents to classify the cleaned view while preserving raw evidence.
- `exception_with_proof`:
  - A sidecar cleaned file is optional if the tool can keep the cleaned view internal and report `cleaned_input_used`.
  - Full content cleanup via `clean-conversation-transcript` is not required if deterministic filtering is sufficient for classifier input.
- `exception_without_proof`: not allowed for classifier behavior changes.
- Fresh external docs: not needed; this is local Python/Markdown/skill behavior.

## Dependencies

- `tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py`
- `skills/sg-conversation-audit/SKILL.md`
- `skills/clean-conversation-transcript/SKILL.md`
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/conversation-shipflow-doctrine-de-langue-20260530-203004.md` if present
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/fixtures/conversation-audit-sample-issues.md`

## Invariants

- Raw transcript evidence is preserved.
- Reports stay private by default.
- Deterministic fixtures must remain stable.
- Owner routing happens only after evidence review, not from noisy classifier matches alone.

## Links & Consequences

- Upstream: tmux capture, raw terminal transcript structure, existing fixtures.
- Downstream: fewer noisy conversation-audit reports and clearer owner routes.
- Security: raw unsafe flag and redaction behavior stay visible.
- Documentation: skill contract must describe cleaned classification.

## Documentation Coherence

- Update `skills/sg-conversation-audit/SKILL.md`.
- Public docs are optional; no public promise changes beyond existing skill page unless implementation changes invocation syntax.
- Changelog/TASKS updates are deferred to `sg-end`/`sg-ship`.

## Edge Cases

- A user message includes code, command names, or `TODO` as real intent.
- A diff contains real user complaints copied from a transcript.
- A JSON report contains classifier categories from a previous audit.
- A transcript has only command output and no usable conversation turns.
- A raw transcript is unsafe but cleaned text appears safe.

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Add cleaned classifier input
  - File: `tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py`
  - Action: strip fenced raw transcript wrappers, diff lines, box/status chrome, command-output lines, JSON blocks, and common shell/search output before category matching.
  - Validate with: noisy transcript and positive fixture.

- [ ] Task 2: Expose cleaned-mode metadata
  - File: `tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py`
  - Action: include `cleaned_input_used`, `raw_line_count`, and `cleaned_line_count` in fixture JSON output.
  - Validate with: `python3 tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py <file> --fixtures`.

- [ ] Task 3: Add regression fixture
  - File: `shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/fixtures/conversation-audit-sample-noisy-terminal.md`
  - Action: create a small sanitized fixture containing an `rg` TODO command and diff question that must not classify as agent behavior.
  - Validate with: default cleaned classifier returns zero findings.

- [ ] Task 4: Update skill contract
  - File: `skills/sg-conversation-audit/SKILL.md`
  - Action: document that all modes classify a cleaned conversation view and preserve raw transcript evidence.
  - Validate with: focused `rg`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC 1: Given a noisy tmux transcript with diff/search noise, when classified in default mode, then command/diff lines do not produce `bad_question` or `weak_follow_through`.
- [ ] AC 2: Given the existing positive fixture, when classified in default mode, then real behavior categories remain detected.
- [ ] AC 3: Given an unsafe raw transcript, when cleaned classification runs, then `unsafe_detected` still reflects the raw source.
- [ ] AC 4: Given `sg-conversation-audit export shipflow`, when the report is produced, then the skill contract says the classifier works from a cleaned view and the raw transcript remains private evidence.
- [ ] AC 5: Given the cleaned view is empty, when classification runs, then the tool reports this state instead of silently treating the transcript as clean.

## Test Strategy

- Regression fixture command:
  - `python3 tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/fixtures/conversation-audit-sample-noisy-terminal.md --fixtures`
- Positive fixture command:
  - `python3 tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/fixtures/conversation-audit-sample-issues.md --fixtures`
- Real captured transcript command when present:
  - `python3 tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/conversation-shipflow-doctrine-de-langue-20260530-203004.md --fixtures`
- Static checks:
  - `python3 -m py_compile tools/shipflow_conversation_audit.py`
  - `python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py <changed markdown artifacts>`
  - `python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown`
  - `tools/shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --all`

## Risks

- Security risk: medium. Raw transcripts may contain private paths or sensitive context. Mitigation: raw unsafe detection remains independent of cleaned classifier input.
- Quality risk: medium. Over-aggressive cleaning could hide real failures. Mitigation: positive fixture regression and conservative line filtering.
- Workflow risk: low. The invocation surface stays stable.

## Execution Notes

- Proof path: `regression-first`.
- Development mode: local; no hosted/browser runtime proof needed.
- Model routing: current main-thread model is acceptable for bounded local Python/Markdown changes; no subagent was explicitly requested.
- Fresh external docs: not needed.
- Dirty scope: preserve existing unrelated dirty files.

## Open Questions

None. The responsible default is to classify a cleaned conversation view while preserving raw private evidence.
