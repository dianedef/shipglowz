# Title

Pilotage Skills Governance Alignment

# Status

Ready.

# User Story

En tant qu'utilisatrice ShipGlowz, je veux que les skills de pilotage utilisent la gouvernance projet locale et le control-plane externe correctement, afin que backlog, priorites, review et status ne deplacent pas le travail dans les mauvais trackers.

# Minimal Behavior Contract

`sg-backlog`, `sg-priorities`, and `sg-review` use the current project's `shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md` and `shipglowz_data/workflow/BACKLOG.md` as the primary operational trackers when a project is selected. `${SHIPGLOWZ_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/shipglowz_data}` remains an external control-plane for project registry and optional portfolio coordination, not the default project source of truth. `sg-status` remains read-only, reads the external registry only as a control-plane dashboard input, and all four skills load shared reporting and question contracts before final reports or user-facing questions.

# Scope In

- `skills/sg-backlog/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sg-priorities/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sg-review/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sg-status/SKILL.md`
- public skill pages when public promises need path/coherence updates
- `skills/REFRESH_LOG.md`
- validation and runtime sync for touched skills

# Scope Out

- No broad rewrite of `sg-tasks`.
- No migration of existing tracker data.
- No change to the external `${SHIPGLOWZ_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/shipglowz_data}` files.
- No commit or push.

# Implementation Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Update `sg-backlog` contract.
- [x] Task 2: Update `sg-priorities` contract.
- [x] Task 3: Update `sg-review` contract.
- [x] Task 4: Update `sg-status` contract.
- [x] Task 5: Update public pages if needed.
- [x] Task 6: Log and validate.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All four skills have `Report Modes` and load `reporting-contract`.
- [x] User-facing selection questions load `question-contract`.
- [x] `sg-backlog`, `sg-priorities`, and `sg-review` no longer call the external `TASKS.md` the single source of truth.
- [x] Project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md` and `shipglowz_data/workflow/BACKLOG.md` are primary for project work.
- [x] External `${SHIPGLOWZ_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/shipglowz_data}` is described as registry/portfolio coordination only.
- [x] `sg-status` remains read-only and does not imply tracker mutation.
- [x] Validation passes or any remaining limit is explicitly reported.

# Test Strategy

Proof path: `scenario-first`.

Pressure scenario: an operator runs pilotage from inside a project with local `shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md`, while the external control-plane also has a portfolio `TASKS.md` and `PROJECTS.md`. Backlog, priority, and review skills must default to local workflow trackers for project work and touch the external tracker only for explicit portfolio coordination. Status must read the external registry for dashboard discovery without mutating it. Any project/scope/time questions must use `question-contract`, and final reports must use `reporting-contract`.

# Risks

- Existing users may still rely on the external portfolio tracker. Mitigation: keep explicit portfolio coordination supported when requested.
- Public pages are short and may not need path details. Mitigation: update only if the public promise would otherwise drift.
