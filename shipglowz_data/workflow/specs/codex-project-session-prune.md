# Codex Project Session Prune

🟢 [ShipGlowz] spec: Codex project session prune | status: ready | path: shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/codex-project-session-prune.md | next: /102-sg-start Codex project session prune

## Title

Codex project session prune

## Status

ready

## User Story

As a ShipGlowz operator, I want to safely prune old completed Codex sessions for one exact project, so I can reclaim rollout disk space without deleting the active session or another project's history.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

`/309-sg-tasks sessions prune [cwd]` previews old completed sessions for the exact absolute project `cwd`. It never mutates by default. An apply run requires explicit confirmation, excludes the current thread, selects only canonical `DONE - ...` sessions inactive for strictly more than the configured age, validates each complete spawn subtree, and delegates deletion to the supported native `codex delete --force <UUID>` command. It never prunes another `cwd`, active/open statuses, unsafe descendant trees, or the current thread.

## Success Behavior

- Default invocation is a dry-run with candidate ids, count, rollout bytes, threshold, and excluded-current count.
- Default threshold is strictly more than 30 days; `--older-than-days` may increase or decrease it explicitly.
- Apply requires both `--apply` and `--confirm-cwd` equal to the resolved absolute target.
- The current thread comes from `CODEX_THREAD_ID` or an explicit argument and is always excluded.
- A root is rejected when any descendant crosses `cwd`, is not independently eligible, has an open spawn edge, is the current thread, or belongs to active agent work.
- Selected descendants are collapsed under their selected root so native recursive deletion runs once per subtree.
- Apply invokes native Codex deletion one root at a time, then verifies thread, rollout, auxiliary-state, and unrelated-project outcomes.

## Error Behavior

- Refuse apply when confirmation is missing/mismatched, the current thread cannot be identified in an active Codex environment, the DB/schema is unsupported, the native delete command is unavailable, or subtree safety cannot be proven.
- Missing rollouts are reported in the plan; native Codex remains the sole deletion owner because it can reconcile stale and compressed session state.
- A dry-run never changes SQLite, rollout files, tracker files, or session titles.
- A native deletion failure stops the apply loop, reports completed and remaining roots, and preserves retryability; never claim global atomicity.
- Never run `VACUUM` automatically; it can lock the live Codex database and is not required to reclaim rollout disk space.

## Scope In

- A Python standard-library pruning tool under `tools/`.
- Dry-run and apply modes scoped by exact absolute `cwd`.
- Canonical `DONE - ...` and strict inactivity eligibility.
- Active-thread and unsafe-subtree exclusion, native deletion execution, post-delete verification, and compact JSON/text output.
- Focused tests with temporary SQLite databases and rollout trees.
- `309-sg-tasks` invocation, playbook, and README integration.

## Scope Out

- Deleting all Codex history globally.
- Pruning `TODO`, `DOING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or `BLOCKED` sessions.
- Deleting the current thread.
- Automatic scheduled jobs, systemd timers, UI buttons, SQLite `VACUUM`, or tracker task deletion.
- Direct mutation of Codex SQLite databases or rollout files outside the native delete command.

## Constraints And Invariants

- Exact normalized absolute `cwd` is the project boundary.
- Candidate selection uses the best available recency timestamp and a strict `age > threshold` comparison.
- The current thread id is immutable and excluded before file or DB mutation.
- Candidate planning may inspect SQLite read-only, but all deletion ownership remains with native Codex.
- Dry-run is idempotent and mutation-free; repeated apply runs safely return zero candidates.
- Unknown SQLite tables or future schema additions must block unsafe planning rather than trigger guessed cleanup.
- Existing unrelated dirty worktree changes are preserved.

## Pressure Scenarios

- `SESSION-PRUNE-DRY-RUN`: preview reports candidates and bytes while file hashes and DB rows remain unchanged.
- `SESSION-PRUNE-CWD-ISOLATION`: identical titles in another `cwd` are untouched.
- `SESSION-PRUNE-ACTIVE-EXCLUSION`: a qualifying `DONE` current thread is still excluded.
- `SESSION-PRUNE-STATUS-GATE`: old non-`DONE` sessions are untouched.
- `SESSION-PRUNE-STRICT-AGE`: exactly 30 days is ineligible; more than 30 days is eligible.
- `SESSION-PRUNE-CONFIRMATION`: apply without exact `--confirm-cwd` fails before staging.
- `SESSION-PRUNE-SUBTREE-SAFETY`: current, cross-cwd, noneligible, open-edge, or active-job descendants block their root.
- `SESSION-PRUNE-NATIVE-FAILURE`: a native delete failure stops later roots and reports a retryable partial result.
- `SESSION-PRUNE-IDEMPOTENT`: a second apply reports zero candidates and no error.

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Add focused failing tests for all pressure scenarios.
- [ ] Implement candidate discovery, dry-run reporting, and strict safety gates.
- [ ] Implement safe subtree planning, native deletion execution, and post-delete verification.
- [ ] Integrate `sessions prune` into the 309 contract, playbook, and README.
- [ ] Run focused tests, metadata lint, skill audit, budget audit, diff check, and runtime sync.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Dry-run is the default and performs no writes.
- [ ] AC2: Only exact-cwd, canonical `DONE`, strictly old-enough threads are candidates.
- [ ] AC3: The current thread is never a candidate.
- [ ] AC4: Apply requires exact cwd confirmation.
- [ ] AC5: Unsafe descendant trees are rejected before native deletion.
- [ ] AC6: Native deletion failure stops subsequent roots and reports a retryable partial result.
- [ ] AC7: Successful apply delegates to native Codex and verifies candidate cleanup while preserving unrelated rows.
- [ ] AC8: Repeated apply is idempotent.
- [ ] AC9: The 309 contract exposes the mode and its destructive safeguards clearly.

## Test Strategy

- Proof path: scenario-first plus standard-library unit/integration tests.
- Use temporary Codex homes, SQLite schemas, timestamps, spawn trees, job states, and an injected fake native Codex executable.
- Never test destructive behavior against the live `~/.codex` state.
- Fresh external docs: not needed; the feature targets observed local Codex storage and introspects schema defensively.

## Documentation Update Plan

- Update the owner skill, reusable session playbook, skill README, and operator launch cheatsheet.
- No public site or editorial content impact.

## Risks

- Data loss from cwd or path mistakes: mitigated by exact absolute scope, containment checks, dry-run default, and exact confirmation.
- Active-session corruption: mitigated by mandatory current-thread exclusion.
- Partial deletion: native deletion is not globally atomic, so stop on first failure and report completed versus retryable roots precisely.
- SQLite schema drift: mitigated by read-only planning, required-table checks, and native ownership of mutation.
- Database locking: use a bounded busy timeout, never auto-vacuum, and fail without deleting when a safe transaction cannot start.

## Open Questions

None. The operator selected prune, the safe default threshold is 30 days, and global deletion remains out of scope.
