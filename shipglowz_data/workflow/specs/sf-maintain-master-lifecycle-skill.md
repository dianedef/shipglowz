# Spec: sg-maintain Master Lifecycle Skill

## Title

sg-maintain Master Lifecycle Skill

## Status

ready

## User Story

As a ShipGlowz operator maintaining an existing project, I want `sg-maintain` to act as a master maintenance skill that can create or continue a spec, delegate bounded implementation work, verify results, and route shipping, so maintenance findings are resolved instead of becoming another list of commands.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

`sg-maintain` must become a lifecycle master skill for project maintenance.

Default invocation should run the maintenance lifecycle as far as safely possible:

```text
maintenance intake -> triage -> existing chantier/spec gate -> spec/readiness when needed -> delegated execution -> checks/docs/audits/security lanes -> verification -> ship/deploy route
```

`quick` remains the explicit read-only mode. Other modes may focus the lane, but they should still execute through the lifecycle when the evidence calls for it.

## Success Behavior

- Preconditions: the current directory is a maintainable project or `global` selects one project at a time.
- Trigger: the user invokes `/sg-maintain`, `$sg-maintain`, or asks for project maintenance to be handled.
- User/operator result: maintenance work is either completed through verification and ship routing, or blocked at a named safety gate with the next concrete action.
- System effect: `sg-maintain` uses specialist skills and bounded subagents instead of duplicating their internals.
- Success proof: the final report names the chantier/spec state, execution mode, checks, documentation/editorial status, verification result, and ship/deploy route.
- Silent success: not allowed. If nothing needed maintenance, report that result with the evidence checked.

## Non-Goals

- Do not make `quick` write-capable.
- Do not bypass `sg-spec`, `sg-ready`, `sg-start`, `sg-verify`, `sg-end`, `sg-ship`, or `sg-deploy` gates.
- Do not duplicate the internals of dependency, docs, audit, bug, check, fix, build, or deploy skills.
- Do not ship with unresolved high/critical security, data, auth, production, or secret risk unless the user explicitly accepts the risk.
- Do not run parallel write agents unless a ready spec defines non-overlapping `Execution Batches`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC 1: `sg-maintain` frontmatter and chantier doctrine classify it as `obligatoire` / `lifecycle`.
- [x] AC 2: Default `/sg-maintain` is a master lifecycle run, while `/sg-maintain quick` is the read-only triage escape hatch.
- [x] AC 3: The skill defines `main-only`, `delegated sequential`, and `spec-gated parallel` execution modes.
- [x] AC 4: The lifecycle can create or continue a spec, run readiness, delegate implementation, verify, and route to ship/deploy.
- [x] AC 5: Public/help/workflow docs describe `sg-maintain` as a master maintenance skill, not a small router.
- [x] AC 6: Validation covers skill budget, metadata, runtime skill sync, targeted role checks, and site build.

## Validation Plan

- `python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py specs/sg-maintain-master-lifecycle-skill.md README.md shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md docs/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md skills/references/chantier-tracking.md`
- `python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown`
- `tools/shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --skill sg-maintain`
- `rg -n "sg-maintain.*lifecycle|sg-maintain.*ship|delegated sequential|spec-gated parallel" skills/sg-maintain/SKILL.md README.md shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md skills/sg-help/SKILL.md docs/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md site/src/content/skills/sg-maintain.md`
- `pnpm --dir shipflow-site build`

|----------|-------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 2026-05-03 19:10:22 UTC | sg-spec | GPT-5 Codex | Created ready spec for transforming sg-maintain into a master lifecycle skill | ready | /sg-start sg-maintain master lifecycle skill |
| 2026-05-03 19:14:40 UTC | sg-skill-build | GPT-5 Codex | Updated sg-maintain contract, runtime label, chantier doctrine, help, workflow, technical docs, README, public skill page, and superseded the prior router spec | implemented | /sg-verify sg-maintain master lifecycle skill |
| 2026-05-03 19:14:40 UTC | sg-verify | GPT-5 Codex | Ran metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime sync check, targeted rg checks, and Astro site build | passed | /sg-ship "Promote sg-maintain to master maintenance lifecycle" after selecting bounded ship scope |
| 2026-05-03 19:24:14 UTC | sg-ship | GPT-5 Codex | Ran full close bookkeeping, metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime sync check, targeted rg checks, git diff check, and site build for the bounded sg-maintain scope | shipped | none |

## Current Chantier Flow

- `sg-spec`: done, ready spec created.
- `sg-ready`: ready by direct user clarification and bounded acceptance criteria.
- `sg-start`: implemented through sg-skill-build.
- `sg-verify`: passed.
- `sg-end`: done through sg-ship full close bookkeeping.
- `sg-ship`: shipped for the bounded sg-maintain scope; unrelated dirty files remain outside this chantier.

Next step: none
