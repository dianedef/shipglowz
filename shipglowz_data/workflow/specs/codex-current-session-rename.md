# Codex Current Session Rename

## Goal

Add `/309-sg-tasks sessions rename <status>` as an explicit, deterministic way
to rename only the current Codex conversation to `<STATUS> - <work title>`.

## Contract

- Accept exactly `todo`, `doing`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, or `done`, case-insensitively.
- Resolve the current conversation from `CODEX_THREAD_ID`; an explicit id exists only for controlled tooling and tests.
- Require the selected row to match the exact absolute current `cwd`.
- Derive the semantic work title from the visible conversation; reject empty, already-prefixed, control-character, or generic work titles.
- Update only `threads.title`, preserve the thread id, and verify the persisted title.
- Do not inspect other conversations, rename forks, mutate `TASKS.md`, or infer a project-task status.
- Treat repeating the same rename as a successful idempotent no-op.

## Pressure Scenarios

- `SESSION-RENAME-CURRENT-ONLY`: a valid command changes one row identified by `CODEX_THREAD_ID` and leaves all other rows untouched.
- `SESSION-RENAME-CWD-ISOLATION`: a current id whose row belongs to another exact cwd is rejected without mutation.
- `SESSION-RENAME-STATUS-GATE`: an unknown status is rejected before opening a write transaction.
- `SESSION-RENAME-SEMANTIC-GATE`: empty, generic, control-character, and already-prefixed work titles are rejected.
- `SESSION-RENAME-IDEMPOTENT`: repeating the same target title succeeds and reports no change.
- `SESSION-RENAME-NO-TRACKER`: the operation never creates or mutates project governance files.

## Proof Path

Scenario-first contract plus standard-library tests against temporary SQLite
databases. No test may write to live Codex state.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Add the guarded rename helper and focused tests.
- [x] Integrate the invocation into the owner skill, playbook, README, and operator guide.
- [x] Run focused tests, metadata lint, skill audit, budget audit, diff check, and runtime sync.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Only the current exact-cwd thread can be renamed.
- [x] AC2: The persisted title uses one canonical uppercase status and a semantic work title.
- [x] AC3: Invalid status/title/current-thread provenance fails without mutation.
- [x] AC4: Repeating the same rename is idempotent.
- [x] AC5: No tracker or unrelated session row is changed.
- [x] AC6: Documentation exposes the exact invocation and boundary.

## Documentation Update Plan

Update the owner skill, its README, the session playbook, and the operator launch
cheatsheet. No editorial or public-site impact.

## Skill Run History

| Date UTC | Skill | Model | Action | Result | Next step |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-16 13:13:29 UTC | 100-sg-spec | GPT-5 Codex | Defined current-thread-only rename semantics, exact-cwd isolation, semantic-title gates, idempotence, and isolated proof. | draft saved | /101-sg-ready Codex current session rename |
| 2026-07-16 13:13:29 UTC | 101-sg-ready | GPT-5 Codex | Confirmed the operator-selected syntax, bounded SQLite mutation, no-tracker boundary, and complete pressure scenarios. | ready | /102-sg-start Codex current session rename |
| 2026-07-16 13:13:29 UTC | 102-sg-start | GPT-5 Codex | Implemented the guarded current-session rename helper and aligned the owner skill, playbook, README, and operator guide. | implemented | /103-sg-verify Codex current session rename |
| 2026-07-16 13:13:29 UTC | 900-shipglowz-core | GPT-5 Codex | Conservatively refreshed the owner contract; retained the 309 route, added no external dependency, and found no source-freshness need. | refreshed | /103-sg-verify Codex current session rename |
| 2026-07-16 13:13:29 UTC | 103-sg-verify | GPT-5 Codex | Verified current-only targeting, exact-cwd and UUID provenance, status and semantic gates, idempotence, metadata, budget, audit, diff, and runtime sync. | verified | /104-sg-end Codex current session rename |
| 2026-07-16 13:13:29 UTC | 104-sg-end | GPT-5 Codex | Closed the local chantier with no live Codex rename performed and no remaining scoped blocker. | closed locally | /005-sg-ship Codex current session rename |
