# Title

Research And Help Governance Alignment

# Status

Ready.

# User Story

En tant qu'utilisatrice ShipGlowz, je veux que sg-research et sg-help reflètent la gouvernance actuelle des chemins, rapports et questions, afin que la recherche et l'aide ne réintroduisent pas les anciens dossiers ni l'ancien modèle de vérité globale.

# Minimal Behavior Contract

`sg-research` writes reusable research artifacts to project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/research/` or ShipGlowz's own `shipglowz_data/workflow/research/` for cross-project/global ShipGlowz research. It loads shared question/reporting contracts and the documentation freshness gate when research depends on current external behavior. `sg-help` explains `${SHIPGLOWZ_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/shipglowz_data}` as the external control-plane registry/tracker only, while project-local `shipglowz_data/{business,technical,editorial,workflow}` remains the source for project governance.

# Scope In

- `skills/sg-research/SKILL.md`
- `site/src/content/skills/sg-research.md`
- `skills/sg-help/references/help-catalog.md`
- `skills/REFRESH_LOG.md`
- validation and runtime sync for touched skills

# Scope Out

- No broad rewrite of all audit/global-mode skills.
- No commit or push.
- No external-doc refresh beyond local ShipGlowz governance gates unless validation requires it.

# Implementation Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Update `sg-research` activation contract.
- [x] Task 2: Update public `sg-research` page.
- [x] Task 3: Update `sg-help` catalog path doctrine.
- [x] Task 4: Log and validate.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `sg-research` has `Report Modes` and loads `reporting-contract`.
- [x] `sg-research` loads `question-contract` before user-facing topic questions.
- [x] `sg-research` names `documentation-freshness-gate` for current external behavior.
- [x] `sg-research` no longer writes to legacy ShipGlowz root research folders.
- [x] Research outputs use `shipglowz_data/workflow/research/`.
- [x] `sg-help` no longer teaches the external control-plane directory as broad project truth.
- [x] Validation passes or any remaining limit is explicitly reported.

# Test Strategy

Proof path: `scenario-first`.

Pressure scenario: an operator at `/home` asks `sg-research` for current docs or a strategic topic. The skill must ask through `question-contract` when no topic is provided, verify current external behavior through the freshness gate when needed, save the report under canonical workflow research paths, and report with the shared reporting contract. A second operator reads `sg-help` and must understand that the external control plane is for registry/tracker coordination, not project business/editorial/technical truth.

# Risks

- `sg-research` still names Claude-specific research tools that may not exist in all runtimes. Mitigation: keep them as preferred examples but add current-source/freshness requirements.
- `sg-help` is a long catalog; patch only stale doctrine hotspots to avoid unrelated churn.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-05-23 20:45:30 UTC | sg-build | GPT-5 Codex | Created ready spec and started bounded skill-maintenance execution for `sg-research` and `sg-help`. | implemented | `/sg-verify research-and-help-governance-alignment` |
| 2026-05-23 20:50:00 UTC | sg-verify | GPT-5 Codex | Verified scenario-first acceptance criteria with focused rg checks, metadata lint, budget audit, runtime sync, diff check, and Astro build. | verified | `no commit or push requested` |
