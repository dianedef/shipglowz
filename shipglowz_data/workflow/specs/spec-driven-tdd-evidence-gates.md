# Spec: Spec-Driven TDD Evidence Gates

## Title

Spec-Driven TDD Evidence Gates

## Status

ready

## User Story

As the ShipGlowz operator, I want spec-driven development to include explicit test-first or evidence-first gates where they fit, so execution keeps its product/architecture contract while reducing unverified implementation changes.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

When a ShipGlowz execution skill modifies behavior, fixes a bug, or changes a skill contract, it must keep the spec or bug file as the source of truth and choose the strongest practical proof path before implementation: test-first for testable behavior, reproduction/regression-first for bugs, scenario-first for skill changes, or evidence-first for UI, docs, auth, infra, deploy, and other flows where automated tests are not the right proof. If no test-first path applies, the skill must say why and name the alternate proof. The easy edge case is turning TDD into a blanket rule that blocks visual, operational, or documentation work, or treating "no test" as permission to ship without evidence.

## Success Behavior

- Preconditions: ShipGlowz remains spec-first for non-trivial work; bug work remains bug-file-first; small local work may still use a mini-contract.
- Trigger: an operator runs `sg-start`, `sg-fix`, `sg-bug`, or `sg-skill-build` on work that changes behavior or a skill contract.
- User/operator result: the final report says whether the work used test-first, regression-first, scenario-first, or evidence-first, and names the validation performed.
- System effect: execution skills gain a compact shared discipline reference and local insertion points without duplicating large doctrine.
- Proof of success: changed skills stay under budget; `skill_budget_audit.py` passes; `shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --all` passes; targeted `rg` checks confirm the gate is visible in each touched skill.

## Error Behavior

- If a task is non-trivial but has no spec, bug file, or mini-contract, execution must stop or route to `sg-spec` or `sg-bug`.
- If behavior is testable and no failing test, regression test, or explicit exception is recorded, verification should fail.
- If the proof path is evidence-first, the skill must name concrete evidence: browser proof, screenshot, manual QA, log, prod check, metadata lint, sync check, or another relevant command.
- If a repeated bug fix attempt lacks cause-root evidence, route to deeper diagnosis instead of another patch.
- Must never happen: replacing the spec with tests as the source of truth, shipping a behavioral change with no proof, logging secrets while collecting proof, or importing third-party skills as trusted instructions without vetting.

## Problem

ShipGlowz currently uses spec-driven development for non-trivial work. That is the right outer lifecycle because it captures user story, scope, contracts, risks, dependencies, documentation impact, execution order, and acceptance criteria. Superpowers adds a useful pressure: before changing behavior, agents should prove the current behavior fails, then implement the minimum change, then verify the result.

The risk is applying TDD too literally. ShipGlowz work includes code, UI, docs, skills, browser checks, auth, deployment, content, governance, and operational workflows. A universal RED-GREEN-REFACTOR mandate would create friction and false exceptions. The useful version is narrower: keep specs as the contract, then require test-first where appropriate and evidence-first everywhere else.

## Solution

Add a shared ShipGlowz discipline reference and small local hooks in execution skills:

- `spec-first`: non-trivial work starts from a spec; bugs start from a bug file; narrow work starts from a mini-contract.
- `test-first`: behavioral code changes should start with a failing automated test when a reasonable test surface exists.
- `regression-first`: bug fixes should start with reproduction and, where practical, a failing regression test.
- `scenario-first`: skill changes should start with one or more pressure scenarios that demonstrate the old contract is ambiguous or insufficient.
- `evidence-first`: UI, docs, auth, deployment, content, visual, operational, and integration work must name concrete evidence before claiming completion.
- `exception-with-proof`: when test-first is not practical, record why and require the alternate proof path.

This is an implementation discipline inside spec-driven development, not a replacement for specs.

## Scope In

- Create one compact shared reference for development discipline, likely `skills/references/spec-driven-development-discipline.md`.
- Update `sg-start` to load or cite the reference when implementing ready specs or mini-contract work.
- Update `sg-fix` and `sg-bug` with root-cause, reproduction, regression-first, and exception-with-proof gates.
- Update `sg-skill-build` with scenario-first validation for skill contract changes.
- Update `sg-verify` or its verification reference so completion claims are checked against the chosen proof path.
- Update `master-workflow-lifecycle.md` with one compact canonical sentence: spec-first is the outer contract; proof-first is the implementation discipline.
- Update `master-delegation-semantics.md` so delegated coding, bug-fix, and skill-maintenance missions name the expected proof path when it affects trust or validation.
- Update changelog and any relevant technical docs if the operator-facing behavior changes.

## Scope Out

- Installing Superpowers as a runtime plugin.
- Copying Superpowers skill bodies directly into ShipGlowz.
- Replacing `sg-spec`, `sg-ready`, `sg-start`, `sg-verify`, `sg-end`, or `sg-ship`.
- Making automated TDD mandatory for every UI, docs, visual, deploy, auth, or governance task.
- Adding many new skills to the discovery inventory.
- Renaming skills, changing invocation keys, or deleting existing skills.
- Changing project application tests unrelated to ShipGlowz skill behavior.
- Teaching `sg-check` the proof taxonomy in the first iteration; it remains a technical command runner and validation surface.

## Constraints

- Preserve ShipGlowz's spec-driven lifecycle as the source of truth for non-trivial product and skill work.
- Keep top-level `SKILL.md` bodies compact; move reusable doctrine to references.
- Do not increase skill discovery descriptions unless a routing distinction truly needs it.
- Keep `Trace category`, `Process role`, canonical-path, report mode, and chantier blocks visible where they already exist.
- The proof gate must not require unavailable tooling. It must degrade to an explicit alternate proof path.
- For security-sensitive proof, do not log secrets, cookies, tokens, private env values, or raw provider credentials.
- External docs freshness is not required for the initial local doctrine unless implementation relies on current third-party APIs or plugin behavior.

## Dependencies

- `skills/references/master-workflow-lifecycle.md`: lifecycle source of truth.
- `skills/references/master-delegation-semantics.md`: delegated mission contract and ownership.
- `skills/references/skill-instruction-layering.md`: where to place shared doctrine vs local activation text.
- `skills/references/skill-context-budget.md`: budget constraints for adding or expanding skill instructions.
- `skills/sg-start/SKILL.md`: spec implementation entrypoint.
- `skills/sg-fix/SKILL.md` and `skills/sg-bug/SKILL.md`: bug diagnosis and fix loops.
- `skills/sg-skill-build/SKILL.md`: skill maintenance lifecycle.
- `skills/sg-verify/SKILL.md`: proof and coherence gate.
- Fresh external docs verdict: `fresh-docs not needed` for the local ShipGlowz doctrine. If the implementation cites current Claude Code or Agent Skills platform constraints beyond local references, check official docs before changing policy.

## Invariants

- Specs and bug files remain the durable source of truth.
- Tests prove implementation behavior; they do not define product scope by themselves.
- Evidence-first is a real gate, not a loophole around testing.
- Every execution path must end with proof matching the changed surface.
- Repeated bug patches without root-cause evidence are blocked.
- Skill changes are validated by pressure scenarios or explicit mechanical checks.
- Delegated agents receive the proof path as part of their mission when it affects trust or validation.

## Links & Consequences

- `sg-start` reports may become more explicit about proof strategy.
- `sg-fix` and `sg-bug` may stop earlier when reproduction or root cause is missing.
- `sg-skill-build` may require scenario examples before changing a skill body.
- `sg-verify` can reject completion claims when proof and changed surface do not match.
- `sg-check`, `sg-test`, `sg-browser`, `sg-auth-debug`, and `sg-prod` remain proof owners for different surfaces.
- The change may improve reliability but can add small upfront friction for quick fixes.

## Documentation Coherence

- Update `CHANGELOG.md` when the discipline is implemented.
- Update `shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md` if it documents execution lifecycle details affected by this gate.
- Update `skills/references/master-workflow-lifecycle.md` only if the relationship between spec-first and proof-first should become canonical.
- Update public site/docs only if command behavior or user-facing promises change enough to affect users.

## Edge Cases

- UI visual work has no useful unit test but needs screenshot/browser proof.
- A docs-only change has no automated test but needs metadata lint, link checks, or targeted content review.
- A bug is reproduced manually but lacks a practical automated regression test; the exception must name the manual retest proof.
- A flaky test fails first but does not prove the bug; root-cause gate should reject it as insufficient.
- A refactor claims no behavior change; validation must still prove existing checks pass.
- A skill wording change has no code test; scenario-first validation should show before/after routing or behavior clarity.
- A delegated agent edits code but omits the proof path in its report.
- A small mini-contract task would become slower than useful if forced through full spec and full TDD.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CA 1: Given a ready spec that changes testable behavior, when `sg-start` executes it, then the run chooses a test-first path or records a concrete exception with alternate evidence.
- [x] CA 2: Given a bug fix request with reproducible behavior, when `sg-fix` or `sg-bug` executes it, then the run captures reproduction, a root-cause hypothesis, and a regression-first path where practical.
- [x] CA 3: Given a skill contract change, when `sg-skill-build` executes it, then it defines pressure scenarios or mechanical checks before changing the skill.
- [x] CA 4: Given UI, docs, auth, deploy, or operational work where automated TDD is not appropriate, when execution completes, then the final proof is concrete and surface-specific.
- [x] CA 5: Given a completion claim with no test, no evidence, and no exception, when `sg-verify` reviews it, then verification fails.
- [x] CA 6: Given the changed ShipGlowz skills, when `skill_budget_audit.py` runs, then there are 0 hard violations, 0 warnings, and 0 body-size risks.
- [x] CA 7: Given the changed ShipGlowz skills, when `shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --all` runs, then runtime skill sync passes.
- [x] CA 8: Given changed references or specs with frontmatter, when `shipflow_metadata_lint.py` runs on them, then metadata validation passes.
- [x] CA 9: Given a delegated coding, bug-fix, or skill-maintenance mission, when the mission is created, then it names the expected proof path and the returned report says whether that path was satisfied.

## Test Strategy

- Run `python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown` before and after implementation.
- Run `tools/shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --all`.
- Run `python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py` on changed frontmatter docs and references.
- Run targeted `rg` checks listed in the implementation tasks.
- Manually inspect the touched skill bodies to confirm local hooks remain compact and point to the shared reference.
- Use one adversarial example per proof path:
  - test-first: a behavior change with an existing test surface.
  - regression-first: a bug with reproducible output.
  - scenario-first: a skill wording change.
  - evidence-first: docs/UI/prod/auth style work.

## Risks

- The new gate could become dogma and slow small work if exceptions are not clear.
- The new reference could duplicate lifecycle doctrine and increase instruction dilution.
- `sg-verify` could become too strict for surfaces where manual evidence is the correct proof.
- Bug workflows could over-focus on writing tests before understanding cause root.
- Directly copying Superpowers wording could create license, tone, or doctrine mismatch risk.
- A third-party plugin could be treated as trusted supply-chain input without review if the policy is written too loosely.

## Execution Notes

- Read first:
  - `skills/references/master-workflow-lifecycle.md`
  - `skills/references/master-delegation-semantics.md`
  - `skills/references/skill-instruction-layering.md`
  - `skills/sg-start/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/sg-fix/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/sg-bug/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/sg-skill-build/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/sg-verify/SKILL.md`
- Implementation approach:
  1. Add one compact shared reference.
  2. Add short local pointers and proof-path requirements in execution skills.
  3. Keep changes small enough to avoid body-size budget regressions.
  4. Validate mechanically before any broader docs updates.
- Avoid:
  - new always-enabled skills unless a separate routing case proves the need.
  - direct plugin installation.
  - broad rewrites of lifecycle docs.
  - changing `name:` or `description:` fields unless unavoidable.
- Stop conditions:
  - a touched skill exceeds budget thresholds.
  - the new gate conflicts with chantier tracking or existing lifecycle roles.
  - verification cannot define a fair evidence-first path.
  - dirty unrelated ShipGlowz files overlap the target write set.
