# Title

Semantic Compaction Of Core ShipGlowz Skills

# Status

ready

# User Story

As the ShipGlowz operator, I want the core ShipGlowz skills semantically compacted through the canonical artifact taxonomy, so agents keep the right responsibilities in memory without confusing routers, masters, specialists, contracts, references, templates, and records.

# Minimal Behavior Contract

When this chantier runs, ShipGlowz must reduce semantic confusion in core skill instructions by making every touched `SKILL.md` state one primary artifact role, one dominant responsibility, one owner boundary, and one proof/reporting contract, while moving misplaced reusable doctrine into contracts or references. The work must start with a sequential pilot before any broad rewrite. Parallel execution is allowed only after the pilot proves the method and a ready spec defines non-overlapping `Execution Batches`. If a change makes a skill shorter but less precise about ownership, lifecycle state, proof, security, or delegation, verification must fail. The easiest edge case to miss is compacting several lifecycle skills at once and accidentally making `000-shipflow`, `001-sg-build`, `102-sg-start`, and `103-sg-verify` sound interchangeable.

# Success Behavior

- Preconditions: the artifact taxonomy chantier is shipped; core skills already use layered references but still contain role overlap, repeated policy prose, and semantically heavy activation contracts.
- Trigger: the operator launches `/101-sg-ready` and then `/102-sg-start` on this spec.
- User/operator result: core ShipGlowz skills become easier to reason about: router skills route, master skills orchestrate, specialist skills execute, contracts define rules, references support application, templates shape artifacts, and records trace cases.
- System effect: selected core skill bodies and any extracted references preserve existing behavior while reducing role ambiguity, duplicated doctrine, and wording that hides lifecycle ownership.
- Proof of success: budget audit, runtime skill sync, metadata lint, targeted `rg` checks, and a manual role-boundary review all pass; pilot findings justify whether later batches can run in parallel or must remain sequential.

# Error Behavior

- If the pilot finds that the taxonomy is insufficient for a core skill, stop and update the taxonomy or this spec before touching more skills.
- If two skills would need the same owner sentence after compaction, stop and re-separate their responsibilities.
- If a parallel batch would touch the same shared reference or lifecycle contract as another batch, it is not parallel-safe.
- If validation cannot prove preserved chantier tracing, report semantics, delegation semantics, and proof-owner routing, the result is `partial` or `blocked`.
- Must never happen: shortening a skill by deleting mandatory loaders, trace categories, process roles, stop conditions, security gates, report modes, or lifecycle result semantics.

# Problem

ShipGlowz has already reduced several forms of instruction bloat: long bodies were layered, descriptions were compacted, and a canonical artifact taxonomy now exists. The remaining problem is semantic density and role confusion inside the most important skill surfaces.

The core skills are especially risky because they form the lifecycle spine. A small wording drift in one of them can change how agents decide whether to create a spec, route to a master skill, execute a ready spec, verify proof, close a chantier, or ship. Broad parallel rewriting would be faster, but it would make integration risk too high unless each batch has a non-overlapping write surface and a shared pilot pattern.

# Solution

Use a staged execution model:

1. Run a **sequential pilot** on a representative vertical slice: `000-shipflow`, `001-sg-build`, and `102-sg-start`.
2. Verify the pilot against the artifact taxonomy, existing behavior, and lifecycle proof/report contracts.
3. Only then run **spec-gated parallel batches** for independent families, with one integration owner and no overlapping writes.

The pilot is mandatory because it tests the method across the three highest-risk role boundaries: entrypoint router, master workflow, and specialist/lifecycle execution. Later batch work may be parallel only when the ready spec lists explicit `Execution Batches` with file ownership, forbidden files, validation, and integration order.

## Pilot Role Matrix

| Skill | Artifact type | Dominant responsibility | Forbidden content | Must-preserve sentence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `skills/000-shipflow/SKILL.md` | `entrypoint-router` | Select a single safe owner route and hand off in the main thread | Lifecycle orchestration, durable proof routing, closure bookkeeping, reusable contract text | `000-shipflow` is a route-first router, not a lifecycle executor. |
| `skills/001-sg-build/SKILL.md` | `master-workflow` | Orchestrate the full lifecycle from readiness to closure handoff | Router-only behavior, specialist execution detail, standalone closure claims | `001-sg-build` remains the lifecycle orchestrator through closure handoff. |
| `skills/102-sg-start/SKILL.md` | `specialist-workflow` | Implement ready specs and run local, non-destructive verification when eligible | Master-level orchestration, trace semantics, shipping and lifecycle closure sequencing | `102-sg-start` signals `implemented` when implementation is complete and routes missing proof to the right owner. |

# Scope In

- Semantically compact the core ShipGlowz skill activation contracts using the canonical artifact taxonomy.
- Preserve runtime skill names, public invocation forms, and lifecycle behavior.
- Add or update compact role-boundary language for `entrypoint-router`, `master-workflow`, and `specialist-workflow` skills.
- Extract misplaced reusable doctrine from skill bodies into `contract` or `reference` files only when doing so reduces confusion and preserves behavior.
- Update technical docs only where they must reflect the changed semantic contract.
- Define a pilot-first execution strategy and later parallel batch criteria.
- Produce proof that core lifecycle distinctions remain visible to agents after compaction.

# Scope Out

- Renaming skills, changing three-digit codes, or changing public command syntax.
- Rewriting all 68 skills in one wave.
- Reopening description-budget-only compaction unless a description directly contradicts the semantic role.
- Changing the artifact taxonomy itself except through an explicit blocked finding and follow-up spec update.
- Public site packaging, plugin distribution, or runtime installer behavior unless touched docs already describe the core skill semantics incorrectly.
- Editing records such as past specs to reclassify their histories.

# Constraints

- Pilot before parallelism is mandatory.
- Sequential execution remains the default for write work.
- Parallel execution is allowed only after `/101-sg-ready` approves explicit `Execution Batches`.
- Each batch must own disjoint files and must not concurrently edit shared references.
- Each touched skill must retain required loaders: canonical paths, reporting contract, chantier tracking where applicable, and local required references.
- Each touched lifecycle skill must preserve result semantics and next-owner routing.
- No skill may gain a second primary artifact type in its activation contract.
- Internal contracts and matrices remain in English; final user reports may be French.
- Existing unrelated dirty work must not be staged, reverted, or rewritten.

# Test Contract

- Surface profile: ShipGlowz governance, skill activation contracts, shared references, and lifecycle docs.
- Automated proof available:
  - `python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py <changed-frontmatter-artifacts>`
  - `python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown`
  - `tools/shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --all`
  - targeted `rg` checks for artifact roles, trace categories, report modes, result semantics, and forbidden drift.
- Non-automated proof required:
  - manual role-boundary review for every touched core skill
  - pilot review before any batch fan-out
- Ordered proof path:
  1. pilot role matrix before edits
  2. pilot edits
  3. pilot validations and manual boundary review
  4. readiness decision for sequential continuation or parallel batches
  5. batch edits, validations, integration review
- Manual checklist expected if more than the pilot is implemented: `shipglowz_data/workflow/test-checklists/semantic-compaction-of-core-shipflow-skills.md`
- Fresh external docs verdict: `fresh-docs not needed`, because this chantier changes local ShipGlowz instruction architecture, not provider behavior.

# Dependencies

- `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/shipflow-artifact-taxonomy-for-skills-and-references.md`: canonical artifact role taxonomy and anti-pattern matrix.
- `skills/references/skill-instruction-layering.md`: activation contract versus reference placement.
- `skills/references/decision-quality-contract.md`: quality bar and structure replacement doctrine.
- `skills/references/chantier-tracking.md`: lifecycle trace requirements.
- `skills/references/reporting-contract.md`: final report and compact chantier block requirements.
- `skills/references/master-delegation-semantics.md`: sequential and parallel delegation semantics.
- `skills/references/master-workflow-lifecycle.md`: master lifecycle skeleton.
- `shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md`: docs surface for runtime skill role alignment.
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`: docs surface for spec-first lifecycle alignment.

# Invariants

- `000-shipflow` remains an `entrypoint-router`, not a master lifecycle executor.
- `001-sg-build` remains a `master-workflow`, not a specialist executor or pure router.
- `100-sg-spec`, `101-sg-ready`, `102-sg-start`, `103-sg-verify`, `104-sg-end`, and `005-sg-ship` keep their lifecycle source-of-truth roles.
- `102-sg-start` implementation-complete semantics remain distinct from `103-sg-verify` proof completeness.
- `104-sg-end` closure remains distinct from `005-sg-ship` commit/push.
- Shared mandatory rules belong in `contract` references; usage maps and examples belong in `reference` files.
- The work improves semantic clarity before reducing line count.

# Links & Consequences

- Core skills are loaded frequently; bad wording can change agent routing, lifecycle state, validation, or ship behavior.
- Any touched shared reference may affect multiple skills and must be treated as a contract change, not a wording-only edit.
- Documentation updates are required if skill role boundaries or the lifecycle summary change.
- Runtime skill sync must pass after any skill-body edit.
- Public/plugin packaging may observe changed descriptions or help text, but plugin distribution itself is not in scope unless a changed file directly affects it.

# Documentation Coherence

- Update `shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md` if core role boundaries change materially.
- Update `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md` only if lifecycle doctrine or command guidance changes.
- Do not update `README.md` unless user-facing public command promises change.
- Do not update `AGENT.md` unless entrypoint routing instructions become stale.
- Changelog and task tracker updates belong to `104-sg-end` / `005-sg-ship`, not this spec.

# Edge Cases

- A shorter `000-shipflow` starts sounding like it may execute lifecycle work itself.
- A shorter `001-sg-build` loses its obligation to continue through `104-sg-end` and `005-sg-ship`.
- A shorter `102-sg-start` collapses `implemented` into `verified`.
- A shorter `103-sg-verify` stops naming the owner route for missing proof.
- Shared references become broader and more confusing than the skill bodies they replace.
- Parallel agents edit the same shared reference, producing coherent local diffs but incoherent merged doctrine.

  - Notes: Execute sequentially, not in parallel.

- [x] Task 3: Verify the pilot before expanding.
  - Files: `skills/000-shipflow/SKILL.md`, `skills/001-sg-build/SKILL.md`, `skills/102-sg-start/SKILL.md`, changed references/docs if any.

- [x] Task 4: Decide batch topology after the pilot.
  - File: `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/semantic-compaction-of-core-shipflow-skills.md`
  - Action: Record whether continuation remains sequential or may use approved `Execution Batches`.
  - User story link: Turns the user's parallel-versus-sequential question into an enforceable gate.
  - Depends on: Task 3.
  - Validate with: `rg -n "Execution Batches|Sequential continuation|parallel-safe|integration owner" shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/semantic-compaction-of-core-shipflow-skills.md`
  - Notes: This run keeps execution sequential and closes at pilot scope pending explicit approval for broader batch execution.

- [x] Task 5: Batch A, lifecycle gate skills.

  - Action: Align semantic role language and remove duplicate or misplaced doctrine without changing lifecycle behavior.
  - User story link: Clarifies the lifecycle spine after the pilot proves the method.
  - Depends on: Task 4.
  - Validate with: `rg -n "Trace category|Process role|Report Modes|Result|Verdict|Chantier|next step" skills/100-sg-spec/SKILL.md skills/101-sg-ready/SKILL.md skills/103-sg-verify/SKILL.md skills/104-sg-end/SKILL.md skills/005-sg-ship/SKILL.md`
  - Notes: Use one bounded execution batch with skill-local edits only; if any touched skill requires a shared-reference rewrite, stop Batch A and move that doctrine to Task 6 instead of widening the write set in-flight.

- [x] Task 6: Batch B, shared contracts and docs integration.
  - Files: `skills/references/skill-instruction-layering.md`, relevant `skills/references/*.md`, `shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`
  - Action: Move or clarify reusable semantic doctrine discovered during skill edits.
  - User story link: Keeps shared doctrine in the right artifact type.
  - Depends on: Task 4 and any batch that discovers shared-reference drift.
  - Validate with: `python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py <changed-frontmatter-artifacts>`
  - Notes: No shared-reference drift was discovered during Batch A, so this batch closed as not needed for this run.

- [x] Task 7: Final integration and proof.
  - Files: all touched skill, reference, and docs files.
  - Action: Run full validations, review final diffs for role drift, update current chantier flow, and route to `103-sg-verify`.
  - User story link: Ensures the final system is clearer, not only shorter.
  - Depends on: Tasks 5-6 or documented sequential subset.
  - Validate with: metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime sync, targeted role-boundary `rg`, and manual review.
  - Notes: Do not close or ship until `103-sg-verify` passes.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC 1: Given `000-shipflow` is read after compaction, when an agent evaluates it, then it can tell it routes and does not execute lifecycle work.
- [ ] AC 2: Given `001-sg-build` is read after compaction, when an agent evaluates it, then it can tell it orchestrates the full lifecycle through closure and ship routing.
- [ ] AC 3: Given `102-sg-start` is read after compaction, when local implementation is complete but hosted/manual proof is missing, then its result semantics still produce `implemented` and route proof to the right owner rather than `partial`.
- [ ] AC 4: Given a shared rule is moved out of a skill body, when the target file is classified, then it is a `contract` if mandatory or a `reference` if supportive.
- [ ] AC 5: Given the pilot has not been verified, when an implementation agent tries to fan out parallel write batches, then the run blocks.
- [ ] AC 6: Given `Execution Batches` are approved after the pilot, when two subagents run in parallel, then their write sets do not overlap and an integration owner validates the merge.
- [ ] AC 7: Given all selected skills are changed, when validation runs, then metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime sync, and targeted role-boundary checks pass.
- [ ] AC 8: Given final verification runs, when it compares behavior before and after, then no lifecycle, security, reporting, delegation, or proof-owner gate is weakened.

# Test Strategy

- Start with a spec-only pilot analysis.
- Run pilot edits sequentially with one integration context.
- Use targeted `rg` for role markers and must-preserve semantics.
- Use `skill_budget_audit` as a guardrail, not the main success metric.
- Use `shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --all` after any skill edit.
- Use metadata lint on every changed frontmatter artifact.
- Use manual role-boundary review before approving parallel batches.

# Risks

- High: a concise skill may become less precise and cause wrong routing.
- High: shared reference edits can affect many skills indirectly.
- Medium: parallel batches can create coherent local edits that contradict each other after merge.
- Medium: agents may optimize for budget reduction instead of semantic clarity.
- Low: no runtime application code, user data, auth provider, deployment, or external API behavior is changed.
- Security impact is procedural: weakening redaction, permission, proof, or reporting gates would be security-relevant even though no runtime auth code is touched.

# Execution Notes

- Recommended execution: **pilot sequential first, then decide**.
- Do not start with broad parallelism.
- Read first:
  - `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/shipflow-artifact-taxonomy-for-skills-and-references.md`
  - `skills/references/skill-instruction-layering.md`
  - `skills/references/master-delegation-semantics.md`
  - `skills/references/master-workflow-lifecycle.md`
  - the touched `SKILL.md` files
- Parallelism policy:
  - Pilot: sequential only.
  - After pilot: parallel allowed only for independent skill files with no shared-reference edits.
  - Shared reference edits: sequential integration owner only.
  - Final integration: sequential only.
- Suggested post-pilot `Execution Batches`, if the pilot passes:
  - Batch A: lifecycle gate skills (`100`, `101`, `103`, `104`, `005`) with no shared-reference writes.
  - Batch B: docs/reference integration, sequential or isolated after Batch A findings.
  - Batch C: optional downstream specialist families only after a separate ready update to this spec.
- Batch A execution rule:
  - preferred topology: one subagent may edit disjoint skill files in parallel only if each file change stays skill-local and no shared reference, taxonomy artifact, or lifecycle doc needs mutation
  - integration owner: the main agent reviews every diff together before verification
  - automatic fallback: if semantic cleanup in `100`, `101`, `103`, `104`, or `005` reveals duplicate doctrine that belongs in a shared contract, stop parallel fan-out immediately and resume sequentially under Task 6
- Stop if a proposed edit changes behavior, removes a gate, overlaps another batch's write ownership, or needs a taxonomy change.

# Open Questions

None. The recommended strategy is explicit: sequential pilot first; parallel only after pilot proof and ready `Execution Batches`.
