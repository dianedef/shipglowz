# Title

Agent Clarity Public Docs Handoffs Phase 2

## Status

reviewed

## User Story

As the ShipGlowz operator, I want public and repo-visible help surfaces to state clear handoff boundaries, so fresh agents and humans know when a surface explains, routes, invokes, or owns execution across help docs, runtime docs, and cheatsheets.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

This phase must make public and repo-visible guidance say the same thing about skill handoffs. Touched surfaces must distinguish explanation from execution, runtime invocation from user-visible commands, and helper routing from lifecycle ownership. The chantier stays documentation-first: it clarifies promises and examples without silently changing workflow ownership.

## Success Behavior

- `skills/302-sg-help/SKILL.md` and `skills/302-sg-help/references/help-catalog.md` make the help boundary and next-owner routing explicit in examples that fresh agents are likely to copy.
- `shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md` documents the public/docs handoff taxonomy so future edits preserve `explains vs routes vs invokes vs owns execution`.
- `README.md`, `shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md`, and `docs/skill-launch-cheatsheet.md` use coherent wording for runtime invocation, skill discovery, and owner-skill handoff.
- The existing OpenCode/KiloCode runtime-pages backlog item is kept explicitly nested under this phase instead of floating as an isolated docs note.

## Error Behavior

- If a doc surface implies that a helper skill continues work it only explains, reject it.
- If runtime docs present internal runtime calls such as `skill({ name: "shipflow" })` as manual operator commands, reject it.
- If examples blur `000-shipflow`, `302-sg-help`, `706-continue`, or owner lifecycle skills, reject it.
- If this phase silently expands into public marketing rewrite or unrelated skill hardening, reject it.

## Pressure Scenarios

- `HELP-VS-DO`: a fresh agent reads help output and must know whether to answer, route, or execute.
- `RUNTIME-VS-USER-COMMAND`: a runtime page must explain what the user types versus what the runtime does internally.
- `CHEATSHEET-VS-OWNERSHIP`: a quick cheatsheet must stay short without hiding which owner skill takes over next.
- `PUBLIC-DOC-DRIFT`: README, workflow doctrine, and runtime docs must not drift into contradictory invocation stories.

## Scope In

- bounded clarity pass for:
  - `skills/302-sg-help/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/302-sg-help/references/help-catalog.md`
  - `shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md`
  - `docs/skill-launch-cheatsheet.md`
- task-tracker clarification linking the broader phase and the OpenCode/KiloCode runtime-pages slice

## Scope Out

- no new workflow ownership changes in `skills/000-shipflow`, `001-sg-build`, or other execution skills unless docs reveal a contradiction that must be split into a separate chantier
- no public site redesign or broad marketing rewrite
- no plugin packaging or runtime code changes
- no aggregate compaction work

## Test Contract

- `python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/agent-clarity-public-docs-handoffs-phase-2.md shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md README.md shipflow-spec-driven-workflow.md docs/skill-launch-cheatsheet.md skills/302-sg-help/references/help-catalog.md`
- targeted `rg` checks for `explains`, `routes`, `invokes`, `owns execution`, `skill({ name: "shipflow" })`, `OpenCode`, `KiloCode`, and `continue`
- focused drift scan across the touched surfaces for contradictory skill-invocation examples

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Write a bounded phase-2 spec for public/docs handoff clarity and distinguish it from internal clarity hardening.
- [x] Clarify `302-sg-help` and its help catalog so examples expose the correct owner boundary.
- [x] Align runtime docs, README, workflow doctrine, and cheatsheet wording on invocation versus ownership.
- [x] Fold the OpenCode/KiloCode runtime-pages backlog item under this phase with explicit tracker wording.
- [x] Validate metadata and drift checks for the bounded docs slice.
