# Spec: Flutter Web Tmux Hot Reload

## Status

ready

## User Story

As a ShipGlowz operator developing Flutter Web from a remote VM and previewing on a Samsung phone through SSH tunnels, I want ShipGlowz to launch Flutter in an interactive server-side terminal session and send hot reload commands for me, so I can iterate without waiting for Vercel builds.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

ShipGlowz must provide a server-side Flutter Web dev action that starts `flutter run -d web-server` inside a named `tmux` session for the selected Flutter project, records the selected port, and exposes commands to send hot reload (`r`), hot restart (`R`), attach, or stop that session. Local tunnel tools must include these recorded Flutter ports in addition to PM2 ports.

## Scope In

- Add a configurable Flutter Web session registry path.
- Add server menu actions for Flutter Web dev, hot reload, hot restart, attach, and stop.
- Use project Flox provisioning before launching Flutter.
- Use `tmux` for interactive process control instead of PM2.
- Extend local tunnel port discovery to include active registered Flutter `tmux` sessions.
- Update runtime and local tunnel docs.
- Add focused shell tests for session naming and registry behavior.

## Scope Out

- Do not replace PM2-managed Flutter Web launch.
- Do not build native Android/iOS Flutter preview.
- Do not install Flutter globally by default.
- Do not change Flutter app source code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A Flutter project with a `web/` directory can be launched in `tmux` with a ShipGlowz-assigned port.
- [x] ShipGlowz can send `r` to the stored `tmux` session for hot reload.
- [x] ShipGlowz can send `R` for hot restart.
- [x] `urls` / `tunnel` include active Flutter `tmux` ports as localhost URLs.
- [x] Static shell checks pass for touched scripts.
- [x] Docs explain that this path is for Flutter Web preview, not native Android rendering.

## Current Chantier Flow

| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| sg-spec | ready | Spec created directly from `$sg-build` intake. |
| sg-ready | ready | Scope is bounded and implementation path is explicit. |
| sg-start | implemented | Runtime, tunnel, docs, and focused tests updated. |
| sg-verify | partial | Static checks and tmux registry smoke passed; live Flutter app launch not run. |
| sg-end | pending | Not run in this turn. |
| sg-ship | pending | Not run in this turn. |
