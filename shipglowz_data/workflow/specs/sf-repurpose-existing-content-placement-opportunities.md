# Spec: sg-repurpose Existing Content Placement Opportunities

## Status

Ready.

Placement decision: update the existing `sg-repurpose` skill. This is a report-shape and placement-analysis improvement inside the existing repurposing workflow, not a new skill and not a replacement for `sg-enrich`.

## User Story

En tant qu'utilisatrice ShipGlowz qui repurpose des conversations, je veux que `sg-repurpose` reste read-only, analyse les contenus existants en documentation interne et en publication publique, puis route les suites d'ecriture vers les owner skills, afin de garder une analyse rapide et parallele sans melanger reflexion et edition.

## Behavior Contract

`sg-repurpose` must not only propose net-new content. For each source or conversation with useful signal, it must evaluate existing internal docs and public content surfaces and report where the insight should be added, demonstrated, clarified, or intentionally skipped.

The required output section is `Existing Content Opportunities`, split into `Internal Docs` and `Public Content`. Each opportunity includes the surface/file, placement idea, audience learning moment, source proof, content move, priority, and next step.

`sg-repurpose` is read-only for project content and docs. It may trace its run into one active spec, but it must not edit content/docs/site files. When writing is needed, it produces `Owner Skill Handoffs`: `sg-docs` for documentation, `sg-enrich` for existing content improvements, `sg-redact` for new long-form/editorial, `sg-audit-copy` and `sg-audit-copywriting` for copy quality/conversion audits, and `sg-audit-seo` for search intent and discoverability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `sg-repurpose` requires existing-content placement analysis unless explicitly out of scope.
- [x] The analysis separates internal documentation from public content.
- [x] Each opportunity explains what the audience did not know, misunderstood, or would understand better.
- [x] The output pack reference includes `Existing Content Opportunities`.
- [x] The public skill page promises existing-content improvement opportunities.
- [x] The skill references the shared master delegation semantics and allows parallel read-only fan-out for non-overlapping surface scans.
- [x] The skill removes direct apply/write behavior and routes writing to owner skills.
- [x] `Owner Skill Handoffs` are included in the output pack.
- [x] The skill still preserves source-faithfulness, claim safety, content-map routing, and missing blog surface policy.
- [x] The run stops before `sg-end` for user review.

## Scope

In:

- Update `skills/sg-repurpose/SKILL.md`.
- Update `skills/sg-repurpose/references/output-pack.md`.
- Update `site/src/content/skills/sg-repurpose.md`.
- Update `skills/REFRESH_LOG.md`.
- Create this spec and stop before `sg-end`.
- Include `skills/references/master-delegation-semantics.md` in review/ship scope if still untracked.

Out:

- Applying actual content changes to public pages or docs from `sg-repurpose`.
- Creating a blog/article surface.
- Changing `sg-content`, `sg-enrich`, `sg-redact`, or audit skills.
- Creating a new `sg-copy` skill.
- Committing or pushing.
- Shipping unrelated dirty worktree changes.

## Test Strategy

Run:

```bash
tools/shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --skill sg-repurpose
python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown
python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py specs/sg-repurpose-existing-content-placement-opportunities.md
pnpm --dir shipglowz-site build
rg -n "Read-Only Delegation|master-delegation-semantics|parallel read-only|Existing Content Placement Contract|Existing Content Opportunities|Owner Skill Handoffs|sg-docs|sg-enrich|sg-redact|sg-audit-copy|sg-audit-copywriting|sg-audit-seo|apply mode|write the content" skills/sg-repurpose/SKILL.md skills/sg-repurpose/references/output-pack.md site/src/content/skills/sg-repurpose.md
git diff --check
```

Fresh external docs verdict: `fresh-docs not needed`, because this change only updates local skill/report contracts and validates through local scripts and the site build.

## Documentation Update Plan

Status: complete.

- Skill contract changed: `skills/sg-repurpose/SKILL.md`.
- Skill reference changed: `skills/sg-repurpose/references/output-pack.md`.
- Technical docs: no impact; no runtime lifecycle doctrine changed.
- Help/README/workflow: no impact; discoverability mode did not change.

## Editorial Update Plan

Status: complete.

- Public surface: `site/src/content/skills/sg-repurpose.md`.
- Claim impact: low; page describes report output, not a new unsupported product claim.
- Blog/article surface: unchanged.

| 2026-05-04 19:09:36 UTC | sg-ship | GPT-5 Codex | Shipped all dirty repository changes in quick mode, including `sg-repurpose` read-only handoff work and related site/docs updates. | shipped | no formal closeout; optional follow-up review |

## Current Chantier Flow

```text
sg-spec: ready
sg-ready: ready
sg-start: implemented via sg-skill-build
sg-verify: verified
sg-end: skipped in quick ship
sg-ship: shipped
```

## Current State

- Chantier identified: yes.
- Current spec: `specs/sg-repurpose-existing-content-placement-opportunities.md`.
- Review gate: stop before `sg-end` as requested by the user.
- Dirty scope must stay bounded because unrelated worktree changes already exist.
- Required next step: user review; do not run `sg-end`, commit, or push yet.
