# Title

Decision Quality Contract

# Status

Ready.

# User Story

En tant qu'operatrice ShipGlowz, je veux que les agents privilegient performance, securite, excellence et perennite au lieu de la facilite, de la rapidite ou du chemin le plus court, afin que les decisions et implementations restent professionnelles et durables.

# Minimal Behavior Contract

ShipGlowz decisions must optimize first for correctness, reliability, security and data safety, performance where relevant, maintainability, durability, excellence, operator trust, and current professional best practices. Speed, cost, token economy, local convenience, and the shortest path are secondary tie-breakers only after the primary quality bar is already satisfied.

The phrase "smallest safe path" must mean the smallest complete, professional, best-practice implementation that satisfies the product contract and preserves security, performance, maintainability, and future evolution. It must never mean the fastest hack, the easiest patch, or the least ambitious acceptable workaround.

Minimal targeted edits remain allowed only as a file-safety discipline: edit the smallest relevant row, section, or module when the correct solution is already known. They do not lower solution quality, proof obligations, security posture, or architecture standards.

# Scope In

- Add `skills/references/decision-quality-contract.md`.
- Wire the contract into shared lifecycle, delegation, proof, question, model-routing, build, start, fix, verify, skill-build, router, and help surfaces.
- Reframe speed/cost/fallback wording so fast or cheap choices are allowed only when quality-equivalent and safe for the risk.
- Update README, workflow docs, technical lifecycle docs, and refresh log for discoverability.
- Validate with scenario-first checks, metadata lint, budget audit, runtime sync checks, stale wording search, and diff hygiene.

# Scope Out

- No new runtime skill invocation key for `decision-quality-contract`; it is a shared reference, not a user-facing skill.
- No broad rewrite of every ShipGlowz skill that mentions small edits or quick checks.
- No change to public product claims beyond internal workflow documentation.
- No commit or push.

# Implementation Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Create the shared decision-quality reference.
- [x] Task 2: Update shared lifecycle, proof, delegation, and question references.
- [x] Task 3: Update model routing and core execution skills.
- [x] Task 4: Update help and official workflow documentation.
- [x] Task 5: Log the refresh and run validation.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `skills/references/decision-quality-contract.md` exists, is active, and states the primary decision metrics explicitly.
- [x] Master lifecycle, proof discipline, delegation, and question contracts load or cite the new reference.
- [x] `sg-model` and `model-routing.md` no longer present speed, cost, or cheap fallbacks as primary defaults when quality, security, performance, or reliability is not equivalent.
- [x] Core execution skills distinguish bounded professional implementation from "minimal solution" shortcuts.
- [x] Help and official workflow docs expose the doctrine so future skill edits can find it.
- [x] Focused `rg` checks show no stale "fastest/easiest/shortest path" doctrine outside forbidden examples or explicitly bounded edit-safety language.
- [x] Required validations pass or any remaining gap is reported as blocking/partial.

# Test Strategy

Proof path: `scenario-first`.

Pressure scenario: an agent is fixing or implementing a non-trivial change and is tempted to say, "I will make the minimal modification so it works." Under the updated contracts, the agent must instead choose a bounded professional implementation that satisfies the user story, proof path, security posture, performance expectations, maintainability, and current best practices. If the robust path changes architecture, cost, migration, public behavior, or security posture materially, the agent must ask a numbered decision question with the high-quality route recommended by default.

Mechanical checks:

- Search for the new contract across shared references, core skills, help, and docs.
- Search for stale speed/cost/shortcut language and verify remaining occurrences are either forbidden examples, compatible fast-path labels, or explicit edit-safety constraints.
- Run metadata lint on the new spec and reference.
- Run skill budget audit.
- Run runtime sync checks for touched runtime skills.
- Run `git diff --check` on touched files.

# Risks

- Over-correcting all "small" wording could remove useful blast-radius discipline. Mitigation: preserve minimal targeted edits as a safety practice, while forbidding shortcut solution quality.
- Model routing still needs fallback options. Mitigation: keep fallbacks, but require quality equivalence for the active risk.
- Broad skill sweep could create unrelated churn. Mitigation: update central shared references and only the core skills/docs that shape decisions.

# Content Extension

User directive 2026-05-24: before shipping the internal contract, inform ShipGlowz users of the positioning.

Scope added for `sg-content`:

- homepage positioning components
- docs overview
- FAQ
- why-not-just-prompts page
- skill launch modes page
- selected public skill pages for `sg-build`, `sg-start`, `sg-verify`, and `sg-model`
- editorial governance maps and claim register

Claim boundary: public wording may say ShipGlowz prioritizes correctness, security posture, maintainability, relevant performance, and proof before speed, cost, or convenience. It must not claim guaranteed security, guaranteed performance, bug-free output, or quantified gains without evidence.

# Instruction Excellence Extension

User clarification 2026-05-24: excellence must be explicit especially in agent instructions. Public positioning may mention quality, but the durable requirement belongs first in the operational contracts that guide routing, model choice, implementation, fixes, verification, questions, and skill maintenance.

Scope added for instruction-level reinforcement:

- `skills/references/decision-quality-contract.md`
- `skills/references/master-workflow-lifecycle.md`
- `skills/references/spec-driven-development-discipline.md`
- `skills/references/master-delegation-semantics.md`
- `skills/references/question-contract.md`
- `skills/sg-build/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sg-start/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sg-start/references/execution-workflow.md`
- `skills/sg-fix/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sg-verify/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sg-skill-build/SKILL.md`
- `skills/shipflow/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sg-spec/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sg-model/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sg-model/references/model-routing.md`

Acceptance: these instruction surfaces must name excellence as part of the decision bar, not leave it implied inside generic quality wording.
