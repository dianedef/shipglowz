# Title

Agent Clarity Hardening Phase 3

## Status

ready

## User Story

As the ShipGlowz operator, I want helper and pilotage skills to distinguish explain vs summarize vs continue in the first screen, so fresh agents do not confuse help output with real lifecycle continuation.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

This phase must make helper-vs-pilotage boundaries obvious from the first screen of the main meta-workflow skills. Each touched skill must answer one concrete operator question, state the artifact or decision surface it owns, and state when another skill should take over immediately.

## Success Behavior

- `302-sg-help` makes it obvious that it explains and routes, but does not continue a chantier or mutate durable state.
- `303-sg-resume` makes it obvious that it summarizes only the visible conversation, not repo state or hidden execution truth.
- `706-continue` makes it obvious that it moves the currently resolved work item forward, not that it provides generic help or a passive recap.
- `shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md` captures the helper/pilotage distinction so future skill edits do not reintroduce ambiguity.

## Error Behavior

- If a helper skill appears to own lifecycle continuation, reject it.
- If `706-continue` appears to be only a summary surface, reject it.
- If wording duplicates deep playbooks instead of clarifying first-screen routing, reject it.

## Pressure Scenarios

- `HELP-VS-CONTINUE`: the operator asks what to do next and an agent must decide whether to explain options or actually advance the chantier.
- `RESUME-VS-TRUTH`: an agent is tempted to use `303-sg-resume` as durable state truth instead of a conversation-only recap.
- `CONTINUE-VS-REROUTE`: an agent sees "continue" and must determine whether to keep the current work item moving or route to a new owner because the next step is actually a different lifecycle lane.

## Scope In

- first-screen mission and boundary clarifications in:
  - `skills/302-sg-help/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/303-sg-resume/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/706-continue/SKILL.md`
  - `shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md`
- narrow task-tracker update for this phase-3 slice

## Scope Out

- public site docs
- broad normalization of all helper skills
- new shared references unless repetition becomes material
- any lifecycle semantic change outside explain/resume/continue routing

## Test Contract

- `python3 tools/audit_shipflow_skills.py`
- `python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown`
- `python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/agent-clarity-hardening-phase-3.md shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md`
- `tools/shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --skill 302-sg-help`
- `tools/shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --skill 303-sg-resume`
- `tools/shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --skill 706-continue`
- targeted `rg` checks for `answers one`, `conversation only`, `does not`, `continue`, and `route`

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Write the phase-3 spec and bind the tracker to it.
- [ ] Clarify explain/resume/continue first-screen boundaries in `302`, `303`, and `706`.
- [ ] Refresh technical taxonomy documentation for helper vs pilotage distinctions.
- [ ] Validate audit, budget, metadata lint, runtime visibility, and targeted routing grep checks.
- [ ] Ship the bounded phase-3 slice if validation passes.
