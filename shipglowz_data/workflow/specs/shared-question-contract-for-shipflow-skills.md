# Spec: Shared Question Contract For ShipGlowz Skills

## Title

Shared Question Contract For ShipGlowz Skills

## Status

Ready.

The behavior is already decided from the captured conversation. No naming, placement, or public-promise question remains open.

## User Story

As a ShipGlowz operator, I want all skills to share one question/default contract, so questions are rare, numbered, contextual, and recommended defaults are chosen only when they are safe and verifiable.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

ShipGlowz skills must use one shared question/default doctrine for user-facing questions. They should ask only when the answer changes route, scope, risk, proof, closure, ship posture, public claims, or technical/product/editorial direction. They may proceed without asking only when the default is clear, low-risk, reversible, inside scope, compatible with current context and best practices, and verifiable in the current run.

## Success Behavior

- Preconditions: ShipGlowz master/orchestrator skills already load shared lifecycle and routing references.
- Trigger: A skill needs to choose whether to ask the user or proceed by default.
- User/operator result: The skill asks a numbered decision question with why, recommendation, and practical options, or proceeds with a context-safe default and states important assumptions when useful.
- System effect: the shared reference is reused instead of duplicating question doctrine in every skill.
- System effect: greenfield platform scope is established before blueprint and stack selection, so credible mobile-capable options such as Flutter cannot disappear because a spec silently assumed web-only delivery.
- Success proof: metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime skill sync, targeted text checks, diff whitespace check, and site build pass.
- Silent success: not allowed; material assumptions or questions must be visible.

## Error Behavior

- If no responsible default exists, the skill asks a question instead of guessing.
- If the obvious option conflicts with project context, public claims, architecture, security posture, or current best practices, the skill surfaces the conflict.
- If a runtime prompt tool cannot express the full decision brief, the skill sends a short framing paragraph first and uses concise prompt options.
- If validation fails, stop before shipping.
- If launch or roadmap platforms are ambiguous and change the credible architecture, ask one numbered product question before placing any major platform in `Scope Out`.

## Scope In

- Create `skills/references/question-contract.md`.
- Wire the shared contract into master lifecycle and entrypoint routing references.
- Keep local `sg-build` and `shipflow` question gates aligned with the shared contract.
- Update technical docs, workflow docs, README, launch cheatsheet, help, refresh log, and public skill pages where the promise is visible.
- Extend the greenfield question contract, blueprint matching, spec creation, and readiness gates with an explicit platform-footprint decision.

## Scope Out

- Rewriting every skill body.
- Forcing every atomic skill to load the reference when it does not ask user-facing questions.
- Changing skill invocation names.
- Changing runtime prompt tooling.
- Shipping unrelated dirty files.

## Constraints

- Internal skill contracts stay in English.
- User-facing questions use the active user language.
- Icons are helpful scanning aids, not required semantic content.
- The shared contract must reduce duplicated doctrine rather than add long local question sections to every skill.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Add the shared question contract reference.
  - File: `skills/references/question-contract.md`
  - Validate with: `python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py skills/references/question-contract.md`

- [x] Task 2: Wire the contract into master lifecycle and routing references.
  - Files: `skills/references/master-workflow-lifecycle.md`, `skills/references/entrypoint-routing.md`
  - Validate with: `rg -n "question-contract|Question Contract" skills/references/master-workflow-lifecycle.md skills/references/entrypoint-routing.md`

- [x] Task 3: Align the main local question gates.
  - Files: `skills/sg-build/SKILL.md`, `skills/shipflow/SKILL.md`
  - Validate with: `rg -n "question-contract|compatible with the current" skills/sg-build/SKILL.md skills/shipflow/SKILL.md`

- [x] Task 4: Update docs and public surfaces.
  - Files: `README.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`, `shipglowz_data/technical/operator-guides/skill-launch-cheatsheet.md`, `docs/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md`, `skills/sg-help/SKILL.md`, `site/src/content/skills/shipflow.md`, `site/src/content/skills/sg-build.md`
  - Validate with: metadata lint where applicable and `pnpm --dir shipglowz-site build`.

- [x] Task 5: Prevent platform scope from being inferred before stack selection.
  - Files: shared question and blueprint doctrine plus build/spec/readiness owner contracts.
  - Validate with: focused `SSRP-009` scans, metadata lint, skill audits, budget audit, and runtime sync checks.

- [x] Task 6: Apply operator-approved preferred stack presets before blueprint matching.
  - Files: `skills/references/preferred-stacks.md`, shared question/blueprint/lifecycle doctrine, and build/spec/readiness owner contracts.
  - Validate with: focused `PSP-003` and `SSRP-010` scans, metadata lint, core tests, skill audit, budget audit, runtime sync, and project-spec coherence checks.

| 2026-05-05 17:14:23 UTC | sg-verify | GPT-5 Codex | Verified shared question contract integration: metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime skill sync, targeted wording checks, bug gate review, AGENTS alias check, diff whitespace, and clean Astro build after purging stale content cache. | verified | /sg-ship "shared question contract" |
| 2026-05-05 17:14:48 UTC | sg-ship | GPT-5 Codex | Quick ship requested for `shared question contract`; staged the bounded question-contract scope after checks, then committed and pushed it. | shipped | none |
| 2026-07-17 08:46:16 UTC | 900-shipglowz-core | GPT-5 Codex | Extended the shared greenfield decision contract after the Best Fried Chicken scope failure: platform footprint now precedes blueprint/stack selection, and Flutter must be considered when iOS/Android are required. | implemented | /103-sg-verify greenfield platform footprint question contract |
| 2026-07-17 08:48:04 UTC | 103-sg-verify | GPT-5 Codex | Verified the `SSRP-009` ordering and failure scenario across build, blueprint, spec, and readiness owners; official Flutter docs, metadata lint, core tests, skill audit, budget audit, runtime sync, and diff checks passed. | verified | /104-sg-end greenfield platform footprint question contract |
| 2026-07-17 13:38:03 UTC | 900-shipglowz-core | GPT-5 Codex | Promoted the existing Astro-site and Flutter-app convention into a canonical preferred-stack preset resolved before blueprints, then aligned the Best Fried Chicken architecture and narrowed its open technology decision to the shared backend. | implemented | /103-sg-verify preferred stack preset contract |
| 2026-07-17 13:39:53 UTC | 103-sg-verify | GPT-5 Codex | Verified `PSP-003` and `SSRP-010` across lifecycle, build, blueprint, spec, and readiness contracts; metadata, core tests, skill audit, budget, runtime sync, project-doc coherence, and diff checks passed. | verified | /104-sg-end preferred stack preset contract |
