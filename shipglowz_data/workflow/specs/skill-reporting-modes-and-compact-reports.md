# Spec: Skill Reporting Modes And Compact Reports

## Status

ready

## User Story

As a ShipGlowz operator, I want skills to default to concise human reports while still supporting detailed agent handoff reports on request, so standalone skill usage stays readable without losing technical traceability for internal orchestration.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

ShipGlowz skills that produce final reports must use a shared reporting contract. Default mode is `report=user`: concise, outcome-first, ordered as outcome/evidence/limits, matched to the user's active language, and quiet on successful checks. A few sober status emojis are allowed when they improve scanning. Detailed mode is explicit through `report=agent`, `handoff`, `verbose`, or `full-report`; it is for internal orchestration, debugging, or delegated agent handoff. Skills must not try to magically infer the caller. Master skills that need detailed downstream evidence should pass the explicit handoff flag. Blocked, failed, or partial outcomes must still include enough detail to be actionable.

## Success Behavior

- Successful ship reports collapse push, repo state, checks, and bookkeeping into one status line.
- User-mode ship reports order information as outcome first, evidence second, limits last.
- User-mode labels and explanations follow the user's active language; commands, paths, hashes, and stable status values remain literal.
- User-mode reports may use a few status emojis such as `🚀`, `✅`, `⚠️`, `📝`, and `🎯` when they improve scanning, but they must not decorate every line.
- Lifecycle reports use a compact chantier block: path first, then one `Flux:` line.
- Empty `Reste a faire`, `Prochaine etape`, `Trace spec`, and verdict boilerplate are omitted in user mode.
- Audit reports remain findings-first but default to top issues, proof gaps, and next step instead of full matrices.
- Agent mode may use existing detailed templates, validation matrices, evidence lists, and handoff notes.

## Error Behavior

- Failed checks, blocked ships, unresolved high-risk bugs, missing evidence, and partial verification must be explicit even in concise mode.
- A skill should include the exact failing gate, command, file, or next action when the user cannot proceed without it.
- If a master skill wants a detailed downstream report, it must request `report=agent` explicitly.

## Scope In

- Add a shared reporting reference.
- Update chantier reporting doctrine.
- Adopt the report modes in master lifecycle skills.
- Adopt the audit report mode in the `sg-audit*` family.
- Update technical and workflow docs.

## Scope Out

- Do not rewrite every historical detailed report template line by line.
- Do not remove detailed audit matrices; reserve them for agent/handoff mode.
- Do not infer user-vs-agent caller from runtime state.
- Do not change git, validation, or chantier trace semantics.
