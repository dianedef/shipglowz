## Title

ShipGlowz Technical Documentation Layer for AI Agents

## Status

Ready.

This is a new chantier, distinct from `specs/sg-build-autonomous-master-skill.md`, but compatible with it. The chantier creates the durable technical documentation layer that Technical Readers, Executors, Integrators, and ShipGlowz skills use when code changes.

## User Story

En tant qu'utilisatrice ShipGlowz qui délègue l'exécution à des agents, je veux que ShipGlowz génère et maintienne une documentation technique proche du code, afin que les agents sachent rapidement quoi lire, quoi modifier, quoi valider et quelles docs mettre à jour sans redécouvrir le repo à chaque chantier.

The expected value is lower context pollution in the main conversation, less repo rediscovery for fresh agents, fewer code/documentation drift risks, and fewer edit-conflict risks when multiple agents participate in a chantier.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

ShipGlowz must provide a code-proximate technical documentation layer: `docs/technical/` contains an agent-readable internal-only index, `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md` maps code areas to their technical docs and maintenance triggers, each major subsystem has either a dedicated technical doc or an explicit non-coverage reason, and `sg-docs` can generate or audit the layer. After every code-changing execution wave and again during end verification, the Technical Reader produces a `Documentation Update Plan` from the map, but the Technical Reader does not become the primary docs executor; an executor or integrator applies updates sequentially by default, with parallel work allowed only when a spec defines disjoint file ownership. The easy-to-miss edge case is shared documentation such as `code-docs-map.md`: even if subsystem docs can be parallelized, shared maps and final integration must stay sequential, and code cannot ship while mapped technical docs are stale or missing.

## Success Behavior

- Given a fresh agent receives a task touching `lib.sh`, `local/`, `skills/`, `templates/`, `tools/`, or `site/`, when it opens `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md`, then it can identify the primary technical doc, related docs, validation checks, and documentation update trigger for that code area.
- Given a code-changing execution wave ends or end verification runs, when the Technical Reader reviews changed paths, then it produces a `Documentation Update Plan` that lists impacted docs, reason, priority, required action, owner role, and whether the action is parallel-safe.
- Given `sg-docs` runs in technical-docs mode, when it scans the repo, then it can scaffold missing technical docs or audit existing docs for stale file references, missing validations, missing maintenance rules, and uncovered major subsystems.
- Given an agent opens `AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or a future `AGENTS.md`, then it finds a short pointer to the technical layer rather than a large copied technical guide.

## Error Behavior

- If a code change touches a mapped code area and no impacted doc appears in the `Documentation Update Plan`, the gate reports a docs-planning failure.
- If a technical doc references a missing file, missing command, or stale invariant, `sg-docs audit` or the implementation review reports it as stale.
- If an agent attempts parallel edits on shared files such as `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`, or `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`, the work is blocked or rerouted to sequential integration.
- If the Technical Reader edits docs directly outside an explicit assignment, the workflow treats that as role misuse.
- If a technical doc includes secrets, tokens, private credentials, sensitive logs, or contradictory agent instructions, verification fails and the content must be removed.
- If `technical_module_context` is introduced without metadata-linter compatibility, the implementation remains incomplete.

## Problem

ShipGlowz already has strong orientation and workflow documentation:

- `AGENT.md` points agents toward the right documents.
- `CLAUDE.md` gives compact working rules and commands.
- `CONTEXT.md` maps the repo, entrypoints, and hotspots.
- `CONTEXT-FUNCTION-TREE.md` helps navigate major shell functions.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` describes system structure, boundaries, and invariants.
- `GUIDELINES.md` describes technical patterns and anti-patterns.
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md` describes the spec-first doctrine.
- `shipglowz_data/technical/metadata-migration-guide.md` documents artifact metadata and frontmatter.
- `skills/references/*.md` contains specialized operational references.
- `templates/artifacts/*.md` contains artifact templates.
- `tools/codebase-mcp/README.md`, `tools/codebase-mcp/TIPS.md`, and `local/README.md` document specific subsystems.

The gap is that this documentation is fragmented and mostly macro-level. It orients agents, but it does not systematically answer: which technical doc follows which code area, which invariants belong to a subsystem, which validations are required, which docs must be checked after a code change, and which docs are shared enough to forbid parallel edits.

## Solution

Create a canonical technical documentation layer:

```text
docs/technical/
  README.md
  code-docs-map.md
  runtime-cli.md
  local-tunnels-and-mcp-login.md
  skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md
  artifact-metadata-and-linter.md
  codebase-mcp.md
  public-site-and-content-runtime.md
  installer-and-user-scope.md
  decisions.md
```

Add two supporting artifacts:

```text
templates/artifacts/technical_module_context.md
skills/references/technical-docs-corpus.md
```

Then connect the layer to the existing workflow by updating `skills/sg-docs/SKILL.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`, and `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py`.

`AGENT.md` remains the canonical agent entrypoint. `sg-docs init` must create and maintain `AGENT.md`. `AGENTS.md` is allowed only as compatibility with agent tools that expect that filename, and it must be a symlink to `AGENT.md`, not a second maintained source.

`templates/artifacts/technical_module_context.md` becomes an official linted ShipGlowz artifact type. `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py` must recognize it and enforce the required frontmatter fields used by governance artifacts, including at least `artifact`, `metadata_schema_version`, `artifact_version`, `status`, `risk_level`, and `docs_impact`.

The external research supports this direction:

- OpenAI Codex documents `AGENTS.md` as repo-level instructions for agents, including navigation, conventions, commands, and checks.
- Anthropic Claude Code recommends concise, specific memory files, with large or specialized details moved into scoped files, and recommends subagents for investigation to keep main context clean.
- GitHub Copilot documents repository-wide, path-specific, and agent instruction files, and recommends project structure, conventions, tool versions, and build/test details.
- `agents.md` encourages root and nested `AGENTS.md` files for large repos.
- `llms.txt` proposes a concise Markdown index of LLM-useful resources, most relevant for public web docs.
- ADR references support keeping decision rationale separate from operational technical docs.

## Scope In

- Create the official taxonomy for ShipGlowz code-proximate technical docs.
- Create `docs/technical/README.md`.
- Create `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md`.
- Create initial subsystem docs for runtime CLI, local tunnels and MCP login, skill runtime and lifecycle, artifact metadata and linter, codebase MCP, public site and content runtime, installer and user scope, and decisions.
- Create `templates/artifacts/technical_module_context.md`.
- Create `skills/references/technical-docs-corpus.md`.
- Add a technical-docs generation/audit contract to `skills/sg-docs/SKILL.md`.
- Connect the technical layer to the Technical Reader and the `Documentation Update Gate`.
- Define the standard `Documentation Update Plan` output.
- Define safe execution waves and explicit no-overlap rules for any parallel work.
- Keep `AGENT.md` as the canonical agent entrypoint and make `sg-docs init` create or maintain it.
- Add `AGENTS.md` only as a symlink compatibility alias to `AGENT.md`.
- Make `technical_module_context` an official linted artifact type.

## Scope Out

- Rewriting all product, business, GTM, FAQ, or content documentation.
- Migrating all of `archive/` or `research/`.
- Creating one technical doc per file across the whole repo.
- Turning `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT.md`, or a future `AGENTS.md` into a mega-doc.
- Maintaining `AGENTS.md` as an independent Markdown source.
- Making the Technical Reader the primary executor for documentation edits.
- Allowing parallel edits without spec-defined disjoint ownership.
- Publishing `docs/technical/` or internal technical details to the public site in v1.
- Replacing chantier specs or ADRs with technical docs.
- Shipping code changes while mapped technical documentation is stale or missing.
- Adding per-file `last_verified_against` metadata to technical docs in v1.

## Constraints

- Sequential by default for shared files and final integration.
- Parallelism only when a spec defines disjoint file ownership and no shared outputs.
- The Technical Reader diagnoses documentation impact; an executor or integrator applies updates.
- Technical docs must stay close to code but must not paste large code blocks.
- Technical docs must be more durable than chantier specs.
- Agent entry files must stay short.
- Code remains the final source of truth for behavior.
- Docs must contain no secrets and no private credentials.
- Docs must not introduce instructions that conflict with system, developer, skill, or active spec instructions.
- ShipGlowz-owned paths must follow `skills/references/canonical-paths.md`.
- New artifact types must be linter-compatible or explicitly documented as non-linted.
- `technical_module_context` is a linted artifact type in v1.
- `AGENT.md` is the canonical agent entrypoint; `AGENTS.md` is symlink compatibility only.
- `docs/technical/` is internal-only in v1.
- Technical Reader documentation plans are required after every execution wave that changes code and again during end verification.
- Code changes cannot ship with stale or missing mapped technical documentation.
- Technical docs do not include per-file `last_verified_against` fields in v1.
- The implementation must preserve unrelated dirty worktree changes.

## Dependencies

Local docs to inspect before implementation:

- `AGENT.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `CONTEXT.md`
- `CONTEXT-FUNCTION-TREE.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `GUIDELINES.md`
- `README.md`
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`
- `shipglowz_data/technical/metadata-migration-guide.md`

- `local/`
- `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `skills/references/`
- `templates/artifacts/`

- `site/`

Fresh external docs checked:

- OpenAI Codex AGENTS.md guide: `https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md`
- Anthropic Claude Code memory: `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory`
- Anthropic Claude Code best practices: `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices`

- agents.md: `https://agents.md/`
- llms.txt: `https://llmstxt.org/`
- ADR: `https://adr.github.io/`

Verdict: fresh-docs checked.

## Invariants

- Specs document chantiers; technical docs document durable subsystems.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` remains the global system view.
- `CONTEXT.md` remains the operational map.
- `GUIDELINES.md` remains the general technical doctrine.
- `docs/technical/` becomes the code-proximate documentation layer.
- `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md` becomes the canonical code-to-docs index.
- The Technical Reader produces diagnostics, not the main documentation edits.
- Shared files are edited sequentially.
- Any parallel doc work touches only exclusive files and is authorized by a spec.
- Every technical doc includes a maintenance rule and validation strategy.
- Freshness is tracked through scheduled audit traces, `sg-docs audit` results, `Maintenance Rule` sections, validation strategies, and `code-docs-map.md` update triggers.
- Audit traces for stale technical docs record the affected doc, evidence, owner, and follow-up.
- No code change reaches shipping unless the accompanying mapped technical documentation is updated in the same chantier.
- Public docs do not expose sensitive internal details.
- `docs/technical/` remains internal-only in v1.

## Links & Consequences

Positive consequences:

- Fresh agents can understand a code area with less context.
- Subagents can be used more often while keeping the main conversation clean.
- Technical Readers can produce precise documentation update plans.
- Executors receive clearer validation expectations.
- Specs can focus on chantier decisions rather than repeatedly rediscovering the repo.

Costs and side effects:

- A new documentation layer must be maintained.
- `docs/technical/` could duplicate `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, or `GUIDELINES.md` if boundaries are not enforced.
- `code-docs-map.md` becomes a shared high-conflict file and must be protected by sequential integration.
- `sg-docs` gains additional responsibility and must stay simple enough to be reliable.
- Internal technical docs may need a public/private boundary if reused by the site.
- `AGENTS.md` compatibility must not create an independent second source of truth.
- Metadata linting must be extended for `technical_module_context`.

## Documentation Coherence

Use this durable split:

- `README.md`: user/project overview.
- `AGENT.md` or `AGENTS.md`: short agent entrypoint.
- `CLAUDE.md`: compact Claude/Codex operating rules.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: global architecture and system boundaries.
- `CONTEXT.md`: operational navigation map.
- `CONTEXT-FUNCTION-TREE.md`: function map for large scripts.
- `GUIDELINES.md`: general technical doctrine.
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`: spec-first workflow.
- `specs/*.md`: chantier specs.
- `docs/technical/*.md`: durable subsystem docs.
- `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md`: code paths to docs, validations, and triggers.
- `templates/artifacts/technical_module_context.md`: template for new subsystem docs.
- `skills/references/technical-docs-corpus.md`: skill-facing reference for loading the technical layer.

Source-of-truth rules:

- `AGENT.md` is the canonical agent entrypoint.
- `sg-docs init` creates and maintains `AGENT.md`.
- `AGENTS.md`, when present, is only a symlink to `AGENT.md` for compatibility with tools that prefer that filename.
- `docs/technical/` remains internal-only in v1 and must not be published to the public site.

Anti-duplication rules:

- A technical doc may link to `ARCHITECTURE.md`, but must not copy the whole architecture.
- A technical doc may link to a spec, but must not preserve chantier history.
- An agent entry file may link to a technical doc, but must not reproduce detailed subsystem content.
- `code-docs-map.md` points to docs; it does not contain all technical substance.

Freshness rules:

- Every technical doc has a `Maintenance Rule`.
- Every `code-docs-map.md` entry has a docs update trigger.
- Any mapped code change requires either a documentation update or a written no-impact justification.
- The Technical Reader emits a `Documentation Update Plan` after every execution wave that changes code and again during end verification.
- There is no stale-doc shipping exception: mapped technical documentation must accompany the code change before shipping.
- Technical docs do not carry a per-file `last_verified_against` field in v1; scheduled audit traces and `sg-docs audit` results record freshness evidence, owner, and follow-up.

## Edge Cases

- A change touches multiple subsystems: the Technical Reader emits multiple `Documentation Update Plan` entries.
- A change touches an uncovered area: the Technical Reader flags a `code-docs-map.md` gap.
- A technical doc exists but its owned file was renamed: `sg-docs audit` reports stale ownership.
- An executor changes code and its matching technical doc in the same sequential task: allowed when scoped and validated.
- Multiple subsystem docs are created in parallel: allowed only after foundation files exist and only with one exclusive doc file per executor.
- Two agents need to edit `code-docs-map.md`: sequential integration only.
- `AGENT.md` and `AGENTS.md` diverge: verification fails because `AGENTS.md` must be absent or a symlink to `AGENT.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` is requested by a tool: create or preserve only a symlink to `AGENT.md`; do not create a separate Markdown file.
- `CLAUDE.md` grows too large: details move to `docs/technical/` or `skills/references/`.
- A technical doc contains public-site-sensitive internals: create a filtered public version or keep it internal.
- An urgent code change lands while docs are stale: shipping remains blocked until the mapped docs are updated in the same chantier.

  - Action : Add a concise pointer to `docs/technical/` and `code-docs-map.md`; keep `AGENT.md` as the canonical agent entrypoint maintained by `sg-docs init`.
  - User story link : Lets agents find the technical layer from the entrypoint.
  - Depends on : Tasks 1 and 2.
  - Validate with : `rg -n "docs/technical|code-docs-map" AGENT.md`
  - Notes : Keep it short; `AGENTS.md` must not become an independent source.

- [x] Task 14a: Add optional `AGENTS.md` compatibility symlink.
  - Fichier : `AGENTS.md`
  - Action : Create `AGENTS.md` only as a symlink to `AGENT.md` when compatibility is needed, and document that `AGENT.md` remains canonical.
  - User story link : Supports agent tools expecting `AGENTS.md` without introducing drift.
  - Depends on : Task 14.
  - Validate with : `test -L AGENTS.md && test "$(readlink AGENTS.md)" = "AGENT.md"`
  - Notes : If symlink portability is a concern in a target environment, block and ask before creating a duplicate file.

- [x] Task 15: Update operational context.
  - Fichier : `CONTEXT.md`
  - Action : Add the new technical-docs layer to the repo navigation model.
  - User story link : Clarifies where to look by task type.
  - Depends on : Tasks 1, 2, and 4.
  - Validate with : `rg -n "docs/technical|code-docs-map|technical docs" CONTEXT.md`
  - Notes : Avoid duplicating `docs/technical/README.md`.

- [x] Task 16: Add a short README mention.
  - Fichier : `README.md`
  - Action : Briefly mention the technical documentation layer and its role.
  - User story link : Makes the layer discoverable without overloading the main README.
  - Depends on : Task 1.
  - Validate with : `rg -n "technical documentation|docs/technical|documentation technique" README.md`
  - Notes : Keep the section short.

- [x] Task 17: Update the spec-driven workflow.
  - Fichier : `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`
  - Action : Add the role of technical docs in the spec-first cycle, Technical Reader handoff, executor/integrator updates, and gates.
  - User story link : Formalizes when and how code-proximate docs are updated.
  - Depends on : Tasks 4 and 13.
  - Validate with : `rg -n "Documentation Update Gate|Documentation Update Plan|docs/technical|Technical Reader|executor|integrator" shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`
  - Notes : Preserve the user decision that Technical Reader diagnoses and executor/integrator applies.

- [x] Task 18: Add maintenance rules to guidelines.
  - Fichier : `GUIDELINES.md`
  - Action : Add technical-docs maintenance, anti-duplication, freshness, and no-overlap rules.
  - User story link : Prevents stale docs, mega-docs, and edit conflicts.
  - Depends on : Tasks 1 through 4.
  - Validate with : `rg -n "technical docs|docs/technical|code-docs-map|stale|duplication|sequential" GUIDELINES.md`
  - Notes : Keep the normative tone of the file.

- [x] Task 19: Review metadata linter compatibility.
  - Fichier : `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py`
  - Action : Add support for `technical_module_context` as a linted artifact type and enforce required frontmatter fields.
  - User story link : Keeps new artifacts compatible with ShipGlowz checks.
  - Depends on : Tasks 3 and 8.
  - Validate with : Existing metadata-lint command if documented; otherwise `python tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py --help` and the adapted command.
  - Notes : Do not treat this as optional unless the linter already supports the artifact type.

- [x] Task 20: Finalize cross-links and integration.
  - Fichier : `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`
  - Action : Resolve duplicate content, link gaps, stale references, and shared-map accuracy.
  - User story link : Ensures a fresh agent can navigate the full layer without broken links or contradictions.
  - Depends on : All previous tasks.
  - Validate with : `rg -n "TODO|TBD|PLACEHOLDER" docs/technical templates/artifacts skills/references AGENT.md CONTEXT.md README.md shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md GUIDELINES.md`
  - Notes : Final sequential integration only.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `docs/technical/README.md` exists and lists subsystem technical docs.
- `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md` exists and maps code paths to subsystem docs, validations, and update triggers.
- `templates/artifacts/technical_module_context.md` exists and standardizes technical docs.
- `technical_module_context` is recognized by `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py` as an official linted artifact type with required governance frontmatter.
- `skills/references/technical-docs-corpus.md` exists and explains how skills should use the layer.
- Each major subsystem has a technical doc or an explicit non-coverage reason.
- Each technical doc includes scope, owned files, entrypoints, invariants, validations, failure modes, security notes, and maintenance rule.
- `sg-docs` can generate or audit technical docs.
- The Technical Reader can produce a `Documentation Update Plan` from `code-docs-map.md`.
- The Technical Reader produces a `Documentation Update Plan` after every execution wave that changes code and again during end verification.
- The workflow says explicitly that the Technical Reader diagnoses and an executor/integrator applies updates.
- Code changes cannot ship unless mapped technical documentation updates accompany the change.
- Shared files are sequential by default.
- Parallel work is limited to spec-defined disjoint files.
- `AGENT.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`, and `GUIDELINES.md` point to the layer without becoming mega-docs.
- `AGENT.md` remains canonical, and `AGENTS.md` is absent or a symlink to `AGENT.md`.
- `docs/technical/` remains internal-only in v1.
- Technical docs do not include per-file `last_verified_against`; freshness appears in scheduled audit traces and `sg-docs audit` results with affected doc, evidence, owner, and follow-up.
- No secrets or sensitive internal details are added to docs.
- External sources are summarized and linked without long copied passages.
- The chantier passes `/sg-ready` before implementation.

## Test Strategy

Structural checks:

- `test -f docs/technical/README.md`
- `test -f docs/technical/code-docs-map.md`
- `test -f templates/artifacts/technical_module_context.md`
- `test -f skills/references/technical-docs-corpus.md`
- `test ! -e AGENTS.md || { test -L AGENTS.md && test "$(readlink AGENTS.md)" = "AGENT.md"; }`
- `rg -n "Maintenance Rule|Validation|Owned files|Entrypoints" docs/technical templates/artifacts/technical_module_context.md`

Coherence checks:

- `rg -n "TODO|TBD|PLACEHOLDER" docs/technical templates/artifacts skills/references`
- Compare `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md` against real repo top-level areas.
- Check that every major area has a primary doc or a reason for non-coverage.
- Check that entrypoint docs link to `docs/technical/` without duplicating it.
- Check that technical docs do not define a per-file `last_verified_against`.

Skill/workflow checks:

- `rg -n "technical docs|docs/technical|code-docs-map|Documentation Update Plan" skills/sg-docs/SKILL.md shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`
- Confirm the Technical Reader role is diagnostic and not the main docs executor.
- Confirm the spec-gated parallelism rule is present.
- Confirm the workflow requires a `Documentation Update Plan` after every code-changing wave and during end verification.
- Confirm the workflow has no stale-doc shipping exception.
- Confirm `sg-docs init` creates or maintains `AGENT.md`.

Security checks:

- `rg -n "token|secret|password|api[_-]?key|credential" docs/technical`
- Manually review any matches to ensure they are generic warnings, not real secrets.
- Verify public-site docs do not expose internal-only technical detail.
- Verify `docs/technical/` is not added to public site routing or content publication.

Technical Reader simulation:

- Given a fictive diff on `lib.sh`, the Technical Reader should identify `docs/technical/runtime-cli.md` and `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md`.
- Given a fictive diff on `skills/sg-docs/SKILL.md`, the Technical Reader should identify `docs/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md`, `skills/references/technical-docs-corpus.md`, and possibly `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`.
- Given a fictive diff on `local/`, the Technical Reader should identify `docs/technical/local-tunnels-and-mcp-login.md`.
- Given a fictive diff on `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py`, the Technical Reader should identify `docs/technical/artifact-metadata-and-linter.md`.

## Risks

- Documentation drift if the gate is not enforced.
- Context bloat if docs become too long or too numerous.
- Duplication with `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, or `GUIDELINES.md`.
- False confidence if a doc is readable but wrong.
- Edit conflicts on shared docs, especially `code-docs-map.md`.
- Sensitive internal details leaking into public docs.
- Contradictory agent instructions inside technical docs.
- Parallelism abuse when subsystem docs look disjoint but final links and maps are shared.
- Metadata-linter incompatibility if a new artifact type is introduced casually.
- `AGENT.md` / `AGENTS.md` divergence without a source-of-truth decision.
- Accidental public publication of internal-only `docs/technical/`.

## Execution Notes

Dependency graph:

```text
Foundation sequential:
  Task 1 -> Task 2 -> Task 3 -> Task 4

Subsystem docs:
  Task 5
  Task 6
  Task 7
  Task 8
  Task 9
  Task 10
  Task 11
  Task 12

Skill/workflow integration:
  Task 13 -> Task 17
  Task 14 -> Task 14a -> Task 15 -> Task 16
  Task 18
  Task 19

Final integration:
  Task 20
```

Safe waves, only after `/sg-ready`:

- Wave 0, sequential foundation: `docs/technical/README.md`, `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md`, `templates/artifacts/technical_module_context.md`, `skills/references/technical-docs-corpus.md`.
- Wave 1, parallel only if each executor owns one file: `docs/technical/runtime-cli.md`, `docs/technical/local-tunnels-and-mcp-login.md`, `docs/technical/installer-and-user-scope.md`.
- Wave 2, parallel only if each executor owns one file: `docs/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md`, `docs/technical/artifact-metadata-and-linter.md`, `docs/technical/codebase-mcp.md`, `docs/technical/public-site-and-content-runtime.md`, `docs/technical/decisions.md`.
- Wave 3, sequential integration: `skills/sg-docs/SKILL.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`, and `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py`.
- Wave 4, sequential final gate: cross-links, final `code-docs-map.md`, metadata lint, docs audit, and lifecycle verification.

Execution decisions:

- `AGENT.md` is canonical. `sg-docs init` creates and maintains `AGENT.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` is compatibility-only and must be a symlink to `AGENT.md`; do not create a second maintained file.
- `technical_module_context` is a linted artifact type and requires metadata-linter support.
- `docs/technical/` is internal-only in v1.
- The Technical Reader produces a `Documentation Update Plan` after every code-changing execution wave and again during end verification.
- There is no stale-doc shipping exception. Shipping requires the accompanying mapped technical documentation changes.
- Technical docs do not include a per-file `last_verified_against` field in v1. Freshness is tracked through scheduled audit traces and `sg-docs audit` results; audit traces record affected doc, evidence, owner, and follow-up.

Read first before editing:

- `AGENT.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`, and `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`.
- `shipglowz_data/technical/metadata-migration-guide.md`, `templates/artifacts/*.md`, and `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py` before creating `technical_module_context`.
- The owned code area before writing each subsystem doc: `shipflow.sh`, `lib.sh`, `config.sh`, `install.sh`, `local/`, `skills/`, `tools/codebase-mcp/`, or `site/`.

Implementation constraints:

- No new package is expected for v1; prefer Markdown, existing templates, `rg`, shell checks, and the existing metadata linter.
- Avoid a generated mega-doc, duplicated architecture text, hidden public-site routing, and a second maintained agent entrypoint.
- Keep shared files sequential: `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`, and `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py`.

Security execution notes:

- Authentication and authorization are not runtime app concerns for this chantier because the work is local repo documentation and tooling, but file-edit authority remains limited to the active operator/agent environment.
- Treat repository content, generated docs, command output, logs, URLs, and environment examples as untrusted for publication; do not copy secrets, tokens, private URLs, credentials, or sensitive logs into docs.
- `sg-docs` audit/generation must validate path inputs as repo-local paths and must not follow a public-publication path for `docs/technical/`.
- Errors must be observable in the workflow as docs-planning failures, stale-doc audit findings, metadata-lint failures, or verification failures; they must not be silently ignored.

Stop conditions:

- Stop and return to `/sg-spec` if `AGENTS.md` cannot be represented as a symlink in the target environment without creating a second maintained source.
- Stop and return to `/sg-spec` if making `technical_module_context` linted requires changing the artifact metadata contract beyond required frontmatter enforcement.
- Stop and return to `/sg-spec` if any implementation step would publish `docs/technical/` publicly or allow code shipping with stale mapped technical docs.

`Documentation Update Plan` format:

```markdown
