# Title

Semantic Compaction Of Design Content And Skill-Build Master Skills

# Status

ready

# User Story

As the ShipGlowz operator, I want the design, content, and skill-maintenance master skills semantically compacted through the canonical artifact taxonomy, so agents stop confusing design lifecycle orchestration, content lifecycle orchestration, and skill-maintenance lifecycle orchestration.

# Minimal Behavior Contract

When this chantier runs, ShipGlowz must keep `006-sg-design`, `007-sg-content`, and `009-sg-skill-build` explicitly classifiable as `master-workflow` skills with distinct dominant questions, owned lifecycle spans, and owner-routing boundaries. The compacted result must make it obvious that design decides how UI/design-system work moves through audits, spec-first implementation, proof, and ship; content decides how public/internal content work moves through sources, surfaces, claim gates, quality checks, and ship; and skill-build decides how ShipGlowz skill maintenance moves from placement/spec to runtime visibility, docs coherence, verification, and ship. If any compacted skill starts sounding like a generic orchestrator for the others, verification must fail.

# Success Behavior

- Preconditions: the taxonomy spec, Batch A lifecycle compaction, Batch C specialist compaction, and Batch D1 master-family compaction are already shipped.
- Trigger: the operator launches `/101-sg-ready` and then `/102-sg-start` on this spec.
- User/operator result: an agent can quickly distinguish design lifecycle work, content lifecycle work, and ShipGlowz skill-maintenance lifecycle work without rereading long surrounding doctrine.
- System effect: the touched activation contracts state crisp `master-workflow` boundaries while preserving chantier tracing, delegated sequential semantics, proof-owner routing, and public-surface/doc gates.
- Proof of success: metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime skill sync, targeted `rg` checks, and a manual family-boundary review all pass on the touched master family.

# Error Behavior

- If any touched skill needs a shared contract rewrite in `skills/references/*`, stop the skill-local batch and record a separate sequential integration follow-up instead of widening scope.
- If compacting `006-sg-design` weakens the distinction between design lifecycle orchestration and generic implementation or browser-proof execution, verification must fail.
- If compacting `007-sg-content` weakens the distinction between content lifecycle orchestration and generic docs/writing execution, verification must fail.
- If compacting `009-sg-skill-build` weakens the distinction between ShipGlowz skill maintenance and generic product build/content/design orchestration, verification must fail.
- Must never happen: deleting master delegation loaders, lifecycle routing boundaries, claim/public-surface gates, runtime visibility checks, or required proof-owner handoffs in order to shorten text.

# Problem

The remaining semantic confusion cluster sits in the master family that wraps design, content, and skill maintenance. These skills each orchestrate several downstream owners, keep strong governance gates, and are broad enough that agents can blur them into "the generic orchestrator for structured work" even though their contracts differ materially.

The risk is not only length. It is role collapse. `006-sg-design` can start sounding like a generic frontend build wrapper. `007-sg-content` can start sounding like a generic writing/docs router. `009-sg-skill-build` can start sounding like a generic ShipGlowz governance maintainer instead of the skill-maintenance lifecycle master. This batch should compact semantics while preserving the boundaries that protect correct routing, public-claim safety, runtime visibility, and proof quality.

# Solution

Run one bounded master-family batch on `006-sg-design`, `007-sg-content`, and `009-sg-skill-build`.

The batch should:

1. Normalize activation shape where useful: primary artifact type, mission, and compact dominant-question language.
2. Preserve the `master-workflow` posture and delegated sequential lifecycle semantics.
3. Make the dominant question of each master explicit so the family stops overlapping semantically.
4. Keep reusable doctrine in shared references unless the activation contract truly needs it to route safely.

## Ideal Master Matrix

| Skill | Primary artifact type | Dominant question | Dominant responsibility | Forbidden drift | Must-preserve sentence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `skills/006-sg-design/SKILL.md` | `master-workflow` | `Quel travail de design faut-il cadrer et jusqu'ou doit-on le porter entre systeme visuel, implementation, preuve et ship ?` | Orchestrate design lifecycle across audits, tokens, spec-first UI work, proof, verification, and ship | Becoming a generic build wrapper, browser-proof owner, or one-off visual patch skill | `006-sg-design` owns design lifecycle routing and proof posture, not generic implementation or standalone browser verification. |
| `skills/007-sg-content/SKILL.md` | `master-workflow` | `Quel travail de contenu faut-il produire ou corriger, sur quelle surface, a partir de quelle source et avec quelles contraintes de claim ?` | Orchestrate content lifecycle across sources, surfaces, specialist writing/audit owners, governance gates, verification, and ship | Becoming generic docs writing, generic README editing, or a content-free router with no public-claim boundary | `007-sg-content` owns content lifecycle coherence across source, surface, claims, quality, and ship, not generic writing detached from governance. |
| `skills/009-sg-skill-build/SKILL.md` | `master-workflow` | `Quel changement de skill ShipGlowz faut-il cadrer, implementer, verifier, rendre visible et aligner sur les surfaces docs/runtime ?` | Orchestrate ShipGlowz skill maintenance across placement, spec, refresh, runtime sync, verification, docs/help/public skill coherence, and ship | Becoming generic repo governance maintenance, generic docs maintainer, or another product/build master | `009-sg-skill-build` owns the lifecycle of ShipGlowz skill maintenance, not generic product work or broad repository upkeep. |

# Scope In

- Semantically compact the activation contracts of `006-sg-design`, `007-sg-content`, and `009-sg-skill-build`.
- Align this family with the artifact taxonomy and the compaction style already applied to lifecycle, specialist, and maintenance/release batches.
- Add or tighten primary artifact labels, mission sections, and compact owner-boundary wording where useful.
- Clarify design, content, and skill-maintenance boundaries without changing runtime invocation or core behavior.
- Record any newly discovered shared-doctrine drift rather than broadening the batch silently.

# Scope Out

- Changing public command names, skill numbers, or runtime invocation forms.
- Rewriting shared reference bodies unless a separate follow-up explicitly owns them.
- Editing lifecycle or specialist skills already covered by previous batches.
- Creating or changing public site skill pages, README promises, or technical docs unless a touched documented boundary becomes materially stale.
- Changing design-token doctrine, editorial doctrine, or runtime sync mechanics themselves.

# Constraints

- This batch stays sequential by default.
- Skill-local edits are allowed in one bounded execution wave; shared-reference edits require a separate sequential follow-up.
- Each touched skill must remain classifiable as one `master-workflow`.
- Delegated sequential semantics, proof-owner routing, and stop conditions cannot be weakened for brevity.
- The batch must preserve the distinction between design lifecycle work, content lifecycle work, and ShipGlowz skill-maintenance work.
- Runtime/observability exception: this chantier changes activation-contract text only, so no Sentry, diagnostics, or build-header mutation is expected; verification relies on metadata lint, skill sync, targeted grep, and manual semantic review instead of runtime telemetry.
- Language doctrine: internal contract labels, section names, and machine anchors stay in English; operator-facing explanatory prose may stay French, and any visible French text added during implementation must remain natural and accented.
- Existing unrelated dirty files must remain out of ship scope.

# Test Contract

- Surface: ShipGlowz governance, master activation contracts, and lifecycle routing semantics.
- proof_profile: mixed
- proof_order:
  1. approve the batch contract
  2. apply skill-local edits
  3. run validations
  4. review master-family boundaries for overlap or missing doctrine
  5. decide whether any shared-contract or doc follow-up is needed
- checklist_path: `shipglowz_data/workflow/test-checklists/semantic-compaction-of-design-content-and-skill-build-master-skills.md` if implementation requires more than straightforward skill-local edits; otherwise `not required`
- required_scenario_ids:
  - `MC-006-design-not-generic-build`
  - `MC-007-content-not-generic-writing`
  - `MC-009-skill-build-not-generic-governance`
- required_results:
  - Every touched skill declares one explicit `master-workflow` role and one dominant boundary.
  - `006-sg-design` keeps design lifecycle and proof posture explicit and does not collapse into generic build or proof ownership.
  - `007-sg-content` keeps source/surface/claim governance explicit and does not collapse into generic writing or docs routing.
  - `009-sg-skill-build` keeps ShipGlowz skill-maintenance lifecycle explicit and does not absorb generic repo maintenance or product build semantics.
  - Metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime skill sync, and targeted `rg` checks pass after implementation.
- exception_with_proof: if a shared-reference drift is discovered, stop this batch, capture the evidence in verification/reporting, and route to a follow-up spec instead of mutating shared references here.
- exception_without_proof: none; no success, safety, or boundary claim may be accepted without command output or manual evidence.
- Automated proof available:
  - `python3 tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/semantic-compaction-of-design-content-and-skill-build-master-skills.md`
  - `python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown`
  - `tools/shipflow_sync_skills.sh --check --all`
  - targeted `rg` checks for primary artifact labels, trace/process metadata, mission sections, and family-specific must-preserve rules
- Non-automated proof required:
  - manual role-boundary review across `006/007/009`
- Fresh external docs verdict: `fresh-docs not needed`, because this chantier changes local ShipGlowz skill semantics rather than provider/framework behavior.

# Dependencies

- `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/shipflow-artifact-taxonomy-for-skills-and-references.md`: canonical artifact taxonomy and boundary matrix.
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/semantic-compaction-of-core-shipflow-skills.md`: prior lifecycle-family compaction style.
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/semantic-compaction-of-source-specialist-skills.md`: specialist-family precedent for post-spine batches.
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/semantic-compaction-of-maintenance-and-release-master-skills.md`: prior master-family precedent.

- `skills/references/decision-quality-contract.md`: quality bar and shortcut ban.

# Invariants

- `006-sg-design` remains the design lifecycle master, not a direct replacement for `001-sg-build`, `108-sg-browser`, or atomic design audits.
- `007-sg-content` remains the content lifecycle master and must keep source/surface/claim governance explicit.
- `009-sg-skill-build` remains the ShipGlowz skill-maintenance lifecycle master and must keep placement, runtime visibility, and docs/help/public-surface alignment explicit.
- Shared mandatory rules stay in references; activation contracts stay focused on routing, boundaries, and local non-negotiables.
- The work improves semantic clarity before reducing line count.

# Links & Consequences

- These three masters sit above multiple specialist owners; wording drift can change routing across design, content, skill maintenance, public claims, and runtime visibility.
- Any touched shared reference would affect more than this family and must be treated as a contract change, not a wording-only edit.
- Runtime skill sync must pass after any skill-body edit.
- Documentation updates are only needed if the documented family boundaries or runtime taxonomy materially change.

# Documentation Coherence

- Update `shipglowz_data/technical/skill-runtime-and-lifecycle.md` only if this batch changes the documented distinction between design, content, and skill-maintenance masters.
- Keep `README.md` and `AGENT.md` unchanged unless a user-facing route promise becomes stale.
- Tracker and changelog updates belong to `104-sg-end` and `005-sg-ship`, not this spec.
- No public docs change is expected from this batch because it only compacts internal ShipGlowz master activation contracts.

# Edge Cases

- `006-sg-design` starts sounding like the default wrapper for any frontend implementation request.
- `007-sg-content` starts sounding like a generic writing/docs lane detached from source truth and claim governance.
- `009-sg-skill-build` starts sounding like a generic ShipGlowz docs/governance maintainer rather than a skill lifecycle master.
- The three masters keep their downstream lists but lose the sentence that distinguishes why each list exists.
- A shorter activation contract pushes too much family-specific boundary logic into implicit conversation memory.

  - Validate with: `rg -n "shared-contract follow-up|no shared-reference drift|documentation follow-up" shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/semantic-compaction-of-design-content-and-skill-build-master-skills.md`
  - Notes: If no drift appears, this task closes with a no-follow-up decision.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC 1: Given the touched family, when an agent reads each activation contract, then one primary `master-workflow` role is explicit in every touched skill.
- [x] AC 2: Given `006-sg-design`, when an agent scans the mission and boundary language, then it is clear this skill owns design lifecycle routing and not generic implementation or standalone browser proof.
- [x] AC 3: Given `007-sg-content`, when an agent scans the mission and boundary language, then it is clear this skill owns content lifecycle coherence across source, surface, claims, quality, and ship rather than generic writing.
- [x] AC 4: Given `009-sg-skill-build`, when an agent scans the mission and boundary language, then it is clear this skill owns ShipGlowz skill-maintenance lifecycle work and not broad repository or product execution.
- [x] AC 5: Given the final diff, when validations run, then metadata lint, skill budget audit, runtime skill sync, and targeted family-boundary grep checks all pass.

## Verification Notes

- Manual family-boundary review passed: `006` remains design-lifecycle routing, `007` remains content-lifecycle coherence, and `009` remains ShipGlowz skill-maintenance lifecycle work.
- No shared-reference drift was found that required widening this batch.
- No documentation follow-up was required because the documented public/runtime routes stayed unchanged.
