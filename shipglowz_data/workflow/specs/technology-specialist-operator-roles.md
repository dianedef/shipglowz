# Technology Specialist Operator Roles

## Status

ready

## Scope In

- Keep the existing `neovim-specialist` as the reference implementation.
- Add specialist roles and invokable profiles for Python, Bash, Astro, TypeScript, JavaScript, Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Convex, Vercel, Sentry, and grouped cloud integrations.
- Link each role to an existing canonical platform note when one exists.
- Keep roles compact: decision rules, preferred skills, validation expectations, and boundaries.
- Add missing platform notes only for technologies without canonical coverage.
- Register explicit profile aliases in `profile-activation.md`.

## Scope Out

- No Supabase specialist role.
- No new owner skills or workflow duplication.
- No copied vendor documentation or model-specific prompt tricks.
- No public site pages in this initial internal catalog pass.
- No specialist roles for Hono, PydanticAI, LangGraph, Cloudflare Workers, Drizzle, or TanStack Start until concrete recurring project use justifies decision posture.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every specialist has one operator-role contract and one agent-profile reference.
- Every role points to a canonical platform note or an explicit shared technical owner.
- Roles cannot override safety, scope, proof, or owner-skill contracts.
- Profile aliases resolve through the existing activation contract.
- Metadata lint and skill budget audit pass.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Add missing platform notes for TypeScript/JavaScript and Flutter/Dart.
- [x] Add specialist role contracts.
- [x] Add matching agent profiles.
- [x] Register aliases in the profile activation contract.
- [x] Validate metadata, references, and skill budgets.
- [x] Add Turso platform note, specialist role, and profile.
- [x] Add CrewAI specialist role and profile using the existing platform note.
- [x] Add reference-only notes for PydanticAI, LangGraph, Cloudflare Workers, Hono, Drizzle ORM, and TanStack Start.
- [x] Register Turso and CrewAI activation aliases and validate the expanded catalog.
