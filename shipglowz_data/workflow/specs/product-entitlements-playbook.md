# Product Entitlements Playbook

## Intent

Create a reusable ShipGlowz reference for product access, billing-provider boundaries, Lifetime Deal redemption, manual grants, refunds, revocations, support triage, and smoke-test proof.

## Scope

- Extract the reusable doctrine from WinFlowz suite authentication and SocialGlowz Lifetime Deal implementation.
- Define the minimum durable data model for product entitlements.
- Define canonical status/source semantics.
- Define provider-agnostic redemption and webhook rules.
- Define fail-closed backend and UI behavior.
- Define smoke tests and docs/update triggers.

## Out of Scope

- Provider-specific current API details for AppSumo, Polar, Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, Google Play, or App Store.
- Tax, accounting, invoices, dunning, and revenue recognition.
- A new runtime skill command.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `skills/references/product-entitlements-playbook.md` exists with frontmatter and active status.
- The playbook states that identity, payment provider records, and product access are separate layers.
- The playbook covers Lifetime Deal/direct/early-bird/partner codes without requiring marketplace branding in UI.
- The playbook defines statuses, sources, event idempotency, revoke/refund behavior, support runbook expectations, and smoke proof.
- The lifecycle technical doc references the playbook so future agents can discover it.
- Validation confirms metadata and no accidental project edits are staged.
