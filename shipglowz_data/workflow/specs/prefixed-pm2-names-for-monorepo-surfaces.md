# Spec: Prefixed PM2 names for monorepo surfaces

## Title

Prefixed PM2 names for monorepo surfaces

## Status

ready

## User Story

As a ShipGlowz operator, I want every generic monorepo surface to carry its project prefix so PM2 identities never collide.

## Minimal Behavior Contract

When ShipGlowz receives a project directory named `app`, `site`, `lab`, or `worker`, it produces `<parent>_<role>` as the PM2 identity; already-specific directory names remain unchanged, and an invalid empty path fails instead of creating an ambiguous identity.

## Success Behavior

- Starting, stopping, restarting, querying, or viewing logs for the same path resolves the same prefixed PM2 name.
- Existing ecosystem files use the convention after migration.

## Error Behavior

- Empty or parentless input returns failure and does not mutate PM2.

## Problem

Using only the directory basename creates repeated `app`, `site`, and `lab` identities across monorepos.

## Solution

Centralize name derivation in one helper and use it throughout the environment lifecycle, then migrate existing generated configs.

## Scope In

- Generic roles `app`, `site`, `lab`, and `worker`.
- All lifecycle lookups in `cli/lib.sh`.
- Existing ecosystem files under `/home/claude`.

## Scope Out

- Renaming physical directories.
- Automatically starting or restarting PM2 applications.

## Constraints

- Preserve names that are already specific.
- Do not alter PM2 runtime state during file migration.

## Test Contract

- Shell syntax and focused naming regression tests.
- Static audit of every ecosystem config.

## Dependencies

- Local Bash, Node.js, and PM2 config format; fresh external docs not needed.

## Invariants

- Every lifecycle operation derives the same identity from a path.
- Generated config remains the runtime artifact, not a hand-maintained source of truth.

## Links & Consequences

- PM2 entries using legacy names require reconciliation on their next managed start.

## Documentation Coherence

- Update the runtime CLI doctrine with the naming rule.

## Edge Cases

- Root-level project names remain unchanged.
- Already-prefixed names such as `winglowz_app` remain unchanged.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Add and adopt centralized PM2 name derivation in `cli/lib.sh`.
- [x] Add focused regression coverage in `tests/cli/input-validation.sh`.
- [x] Migrate existing ecosystem configs and repair confirmed config defects.
- [x] Update runtime documentation and run validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Given `/home/claude/contentglowz/app`, when identity is derived, then it is `contentglowz_app`.
- [x] Given `/home/claude/socialglowz`, when identity is derived, then it remains `socialglowz`.
- [x] No ecosystem config uses a bare generic role as its PM2 name.
- [x] Shell syntax and focused tests pass.

## Test Strategy

- Unit: focused shell assertions in `tests/cli/input-validation.sh`.
- Integration: load and audit all ecosystem configs with Node.js.
- Manual: none.

## Risks

- Stale PM2 entries retain legacy names until explicitly reconciled; migration must not start stopped apps.

## Execution Notes

- Validate with `bash -n cli/lib.sh tests/cli/input-validation.sh` and `bash tests/cli/input-validation.sh`.
- Do not restart PM2 apps as part of this migration.
