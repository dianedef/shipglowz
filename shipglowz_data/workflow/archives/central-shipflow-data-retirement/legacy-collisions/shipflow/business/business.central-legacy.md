# Business — shipglowz_data

## Mission
`shipglowz_data` is the single operational source of truth for ShipFlow planning and project governance. It captures project registries, master task state, and cross-project standards so decisions survive tool or repository changes.

## Problem solved
Multiple projects have different stacks, maturity levels, and timelines. Without a shared layer, onboarding, audit posture, and execution history become fragmented. This workspace consolidates:

- Product and delivery status (`TASKS.md`)
- Project inventory (`PROJECTS.md`)
- Audit history (`AUDIT_LOG.md`)
- Long-lived context and operating standards (`BUSINESS.md`, `BRANDING.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`, `README.md`)

# Value proposition
- Faster onboarding: one place to find current context before editing any project.
- Better governance: shared conventions reduce project drift.
- Clear execution memory: recurring tasks remain visible even when project repos rotate in and out of active work.

## Target users
- You (ShipFlow operator) and agents assisting with maintenance, planning, and audits.
- Future teammates that need project-level continuity.

## Product/Service model
This is an internal operating model, not a SaaS. Value is measured through:

- Faster execution from context reuse
- Lower rework from repeated setup decisions
- Better signal in cross-project audits

## Success metrics
- Master tracker and project-level tracking stay aligned.
- New project contexts are documented before shipping major code changes.
- Required environment setup for active projects is discoverable from `shipglowz_data` docs.

## Current status
- 13 projects tracked in `PROJECTS.md`.
- 0 missing root operating docs before this update; this set now includes required strategy and guidance files.
