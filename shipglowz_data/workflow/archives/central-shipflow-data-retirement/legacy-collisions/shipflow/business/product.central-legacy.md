# Product Context

## Target User

- Portfolio operators and builders managing multiple ShipFlow-enabled repositories.
- Agents and maintainers who need immediate orientation before making cross-project updates.

## Problem

- Each project generates its own `TASKS.md`, while governance is tracked in a single shared layer.
- Without explicit contracts, this shared layer loses clarity during migration, prioritization, and handoff.
- Audit, planning, and project registry updates can become fragmented without a central operating map.

## Desired Outcomes

- Keep project registry, master tasks, and audit history in one authoritative workspace.
- Make onboarding inside `/home/claude/shipglowz_data` deterministic (`AGENT.md` then `CONTEXT.md`).
- Preserve durable cross-project decisions through metadata-ready artifacts and migration inventories.

## Product Principles

- Preserve operational trackers as lightweight sources of truth.
- Move long-lived decisions into explicit artifacts before they become organizational knowledge debt.
- Keep migration boundaries clear between operational logs and contract artifacts.

## Core Workflows

- Intake: update `PROJECTS.md` when a project appears, changes stack, or exits.
- Plan: update `TASKS.md` as global source of prioritization and progress.
- Audit: write outcome snapshots in `AUDIT_LOG.md` and link back to actionable tasks.
- Migration: track document classification and frontier decisions in `migrations/`.

## Scope In

- Cross-project planning and portfolio coordination.
- Operational governance for artifacts that survive beyond a single project iteration.
- Shared standards and migration guidance used by multiple project repos.

## Scope Out

- Source code implementation, build pipeline orchestration inside individual project repos.
- Runtime monitoring and hosting operations (except where those repos reference shared operational truth).
- New marketing stack implementation.

## Success Signals

- Agents can begin work from one file sequence instead of searching multiple projects.
- Project and portfolio context remains consistent across audit, task, and registry files.
- Migration debt decreases as documents become explicitly classified and versioned.

## Risks

- Stale project metadata can persist if `PROJECTS.md` and individual repo paths diverge.
- Master trackers can become inaccurate when changes happen outside this workspace.
- Missing dependencies in migration artifacts can cause future automation to skip required docs.
