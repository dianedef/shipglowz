# GTM Context

## Target Segment

- Portfolio operators who need to coordinate work across 10+ ShipFlow projects.
- Agent workflows that depend on consistent project-level onboarding and artifact routing.

## Offer

- Reduce context-switch cost with a central operational index and standardized entry sequence.
- Provide durable artifacts and trackers that persist beyond individual agent sessions.

## Positioning

- Not a product marketing homepage for external audiences; internal execution infrastructure for project operators.
- Positioned as a lightweight control plane for planning and quality visibility, not source code orchestration.

## Channels

- `AGENT.md` and `CONTEXT*.md` for direct operator onboarding.
- Task execution surfaces (`TASKS.md`, project task files, audit log) for practical usage.
- `sf-*` skills that depend on consolidated project state (audit, docs, and readiness flows).

## Conversion Path

- Discover `shipglowz_data` via workspace onboarding.
- Use it as entrypoint for cross-project edits.
- Feed project updates into `TASKS.md` and track outcomes in `AUDIT_LOG.md`.

## Proof Points

- Centralized registry (`PROJECTS.md`) prevents repository role confusion.
- Audits become actionable through global-to-project task synchronization.
- Metadata migration inventory exists and captures pass boundaries.

## Objections

- "Why not keep each project file separate?" -> this repo already defines shared truth for coordination.
- "Is this another source of truth duplication?" -> only cross-project planning and governance live here, while each repo owns implementation details.
- "Can agents work safely without these docs?" -> they can, but at higher cost and with higher handoff risk.

## KPIs

- Reduction in context discovery time between context handoffs.
- Timeliness of updates in `PROJECTS.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `AUDIT_LOG.md`.
- Decreasing number of unclassified markdown artifacts in future migration passes.

## Evidence Limits

- This context is operational and internal; commercial assumptions are not validated for external sales channels.
