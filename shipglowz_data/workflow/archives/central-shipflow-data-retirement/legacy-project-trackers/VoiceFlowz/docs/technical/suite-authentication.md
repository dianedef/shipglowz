# Legacy VoiceFlowz Authentication Pointer

VoiceFlowz, sometimes written VoiceFlows, is the old name of the current WinFlowz app. This folder is a historical pointer, not a separate current product authority.

The canonical suite authentication decision lives in:

`/home/claude/shipglowz_data/projects/winflowz/docs/technical/suite-authentication.md`

For historical VoiceFlowz material:

- Do not create a separate durable auth domain.
- Do not create a separate `voiceflowz` product entitlement by default.
- Map useful historical requirements to the WinFlowz Android app.
- Clerk is the long-term suite identity provider.
- Firebase remains the WinFlowz app mobile adapter only behind a suite identity bridge.
- Product access must be controlled by server-owned entitlements.
