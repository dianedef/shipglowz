# Suite Authentication Pointer

TubeFlow follows the canonical suite authentication decision:

`/home/claude/shipglowz_data/projects/winflowz/docs/technical/suite-authentication.md`

For TubeFlow:

- Clerk is the long-term suite identity provider.
- TubeFlow product access must be checked through server-owned entitlements.
- YouTube OAuth is a product permission grant, not the WinFlowz suite identity.
- YouTube tokens must remain separate from the suite account and revocable without deleting the user's WinFlowz identity.
