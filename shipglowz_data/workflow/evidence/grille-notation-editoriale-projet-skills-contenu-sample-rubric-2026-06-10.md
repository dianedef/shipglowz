# Verification Evidence: Sample Rubric Outputs

## Purpose

This artifact provides the sample rubric run evidence required by `grille-notation-editoriale-projet-skills-contenu.md`.

## Proof Context

- Proof profile: `evidence-first`.
- Surface: ShipFlow content-governance contracts.
- Project context: `ShipFlow`.
- Rules revision: `business: 1.2.0`, `product: 1.2.0`, `branding: 1.1.0`, `editorial: 0.8.0`, `claim_register: 1.1.0`.
- Content bodies: intentionally summarized, not logged in full.
- Fresh docs verdict: `fresh-docs not needed`.

## Scenario Results

| Scenario | Required behavior | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rubric-ready-project-complete` | Output has full schema, final status, score, subscores, evidence, recommendations, rules revision, and route. | PASS |
| `rubric-project-specific-weights` | ShipFlow weighting prioritizes source faithfulness, claim safety, clarity, and proof over hype. | PASS |
| `rubric-sensitive-claim-blocked` | Sensitive AI reliability/business outcome claim without proof blocks readiness even with high clarity. | PASS |
| `rubric-source-faithfulness` | Unproven or source-unsupported content gets fail/warning evidence and non-ready status. | PASS |
| `rubric-invalid-input-contract` | Covered by schema/rubric contract checks; no malformed sample is consumed as proof. | PASS |
| `rubric-stale-or-conflicting-score` | Covered by `run_signature` and `applied_rules_revision` fields; stale/conflicting states are not final proof. | PASS |

## Sample A: Revision-Ready ShipFlow Article

Project/source context:

- Intended surface: `doc`.
- Input ref: `inline:rubric-sample-ready-v1`.
- Source refs: `shipglowz_data/business/business.md`, `shipglowz_data/business/product.md`, `shipglowz_data/business/branding.md`, `shipglowz_data/editorial/claim-register.md`.
- Content summary: a concise internal doc draft explaining ShipFlow as a disciplined AI delivery framework for solo founders, with explicit caveats around proof and no guaranteed outcome claims.
- Top weighting reason: brand and product contracts prioritize explicit proof, reduced ambiguity, and operator-grade clarity.

Consumption verdict: valid final rubric output, consumable by `sg-verify` as evidence for a non-blocked but not-yet-ready revision state.

## Sample B: Blocked Sensitive Claim

Project/source context:

- Intended surface: `doc`.
- Input ref: `inline:rubric-sample-blocked-v1`.
- Source refs: `shipglowz_data/business/business.md`, `shipglowz_data/business/product.md`, `shipglowz_data/business/branding.md`, `shipglowz_data/editorial/claim-register.md`.
- Content summary: a high-clarity draft claiming ShipFlow makes agents always correct, eliminates regressions, guarantees secure shipping, and improves launch results.
- Top blocking reason: claim register blocks guaranteed security, guaranteed correctness, and business outcome promises without evidence.

Rubric output:

  "recommendations": [
    "Block publication until guaranteed correctness/security/business outcome claims are removed or proven.",
    "Use a Claim Impact Plan before re-evaluating the rewritten draft."
  ],
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "expires_at_utc": null
}
```

Consumption verdict: valid final rubric output, correctly rejected for ship-readiness because a blocking criterion exists despite a readable draft and acceptable structure.

## Verification Conclusion

The sample evidence demonstrates that `sg-verify` can consume valid final rubric outputs, distinguish revision from blocked states, and reject sensitive claim failures even when the global score is not low.
