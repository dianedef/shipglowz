# Content Map

## Purpose

`shipglowz_data/editorial/content-map.md` is the editorial navigation layer for ShipGlowz. It maps where content lives, what each surface is for, and how build conversations or source ideas should be repurposed without rediscovering the content structure in every thread.

It is a structural context artifact, not a content calendar or backlog.

For public-content governance details, use `shipglowz_data/editorial/` after this map. That layer owns public surface impact, page intent, claim boundaries, Astro content schema policy, editorial update gates, and blog/article stop conditions.

## Content Surfaces

## Semantic Architecture

| Cluster | Pillar page | Supporting pages | Target intent | Internal link rule | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI-assisted execution discipline | `site/src/pages/index.astro` | `site/src/pages/docs.astro`, `site/src/content/skills/*.md` | Understand ShipGlowz as a work framework | Landing page links to docs and skills; skills link back to framework story | live |
| Plugin install and activation | `site/src/pages/install.astro`, `site/src/pages/fr/install.astro` | `site/src/pages/docs.astro`, `site/src/pages/faq.astro`, `site/src/content/skills/shipflow.md`, `plugins/shipglowz/README.md` | Install ShipGlowz into Codex and reach the first successful command quickly | Install page owns the marketplace command and first-run path; docs, FAQ, and public skill pages point to it | live |
| Documentation and decision contracts | `site/src/pages/docs.astro` | `README.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md`, `skills/references/canonical-paths.md`, `shipglowz_data/technical/decisions/project-governance-layout.md`, `templates/artifacts/*.md` | Learn how context and contracts stay coherent | Docs overview points to canonical repo docs, artifact roles, and root-vs-shipglowz_data layout | live |
| Skill workflow | `site/src/pages/skills/index.astro`, `site/src/pages/skills/[slug].astro`, `site/src/pages/skill-modes.astro`, `docs/skill-launch-cheatsheet.md` | `site/src/content/skills/*.md`, `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Choose the right skill for a task | Public skill pages should match internal skill names and promises; skill bodies stay English unless an explicit source-alignment plan says otherwise; localized hubs may explain this policy | live |
| Remote agent operations | `site/src/pages/remote-mcp-oauth-tunnel.astro` | `site/src/pages/docs.astro`, `README.md`, `local/README.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/local-mcp-oauth-tunnel-login.md` | Understand why remote agents need local callback routing for OAuth MCP login | Dedicated guide owns the SEO topic; docs overview points to it; repo docs point operators to the local guided setup | live |
| Terminal operator cockpit | `site/src/pages/docs.astro#terminal-tui` | `tui/README.md`, `shipglowz_data/technical/terminal-tui.md`, `README.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/shipflow-terminal-tui-v1.md` | Understand the optional read-only TUI and how it fits with skills, Gum, and Flutter | Public docs state the boundary; repo docs and technical contract carry setup, keys, source policy, and validation | live |
| Content lifecycle and repurposing | `shipglowz_data/editorial/content-map.md`, `site/src/content/skills/sg-content.md` | `skills/007-sg-content/SKILL.md`, `skills/202-sg-repurpose/SKILL.md`, `skills/200-sg-redact/SKILL.md`, `skills/201-sg-enrich/SKILL.md`, `shipglowz_data/editorial/`, future public docs section | Manage content strategy, source reuse, drafting, enrichment, audits, and ship validation without inventing undeclared surfaces | `007-sg-content` starts with this map and the editorial layer, then routes to specialist content skills such as `202-sg-repurpose` | live |
| Content quality scoring | `skills/references/content-quality-rubric.md` | `skills/007-sg-content/SKILL.md`, `skills/202-sg-repurpose/SKILL.md`, `skills/200-sg-redact/SKILL.md`, `skills/201-sg-enrich/SKILL.md`, `skills/206-sg-audit-copy/SKILL.md`, `skills/207-sg-audit-copywriting/SKILL.md`, `skills/406-sg-seo/SKILL.md`, `skills/103-sg-verify/SKILL.md` | Keep project-aware scoring and blocked criteria consistent across owner skills | Owner skills must consume one rubric output schema; `103-sg-verify` rejects stale/recoverable score states as proof | live |
| Editorial governance | `shipglowz_data/editorial/README.md` | `shipglowz_data/editorial/public-surface-map.md`, `shipglowz_data/editorial/page-intent-map.md`, `shipglowz_data/editorial/claim-register.md`, `shipglowz_data/editorial/editorial-update-gate.md`, `shipglowz_data/editorial/astro-content-schema-policy.md`, `shipglowz_data/editorial/blog-and-article-surface-policy.md` | Keep public pages, README, FAQ, skill pages, indexed blog articles, standalone editorial pages, and claims aligned with product truth | Public-content work starts at `shipglowz_data/editorial/content-map.md`, then uses the editorial layer for gates and evidence | live |

## Page Roles

| Page type | Job | Must include | Must not include |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing page | Explain the offer and drive a qualified visitor to the next action | Product name, audience, core promise, proof direction, CTA | Claims unsupported by product docs or GTM |
| Docs overview | Explain artifact roles and navigation | Context layer, decision contracts, links to canonical docs | Implementation detail better suited for repo docs |
| Public skill page | Explain a workflow in human language | Use case, outcome, when to use it | Internal-only implementation prompts |
| Skill launch cheatsheet | Explain which skill to launch and which arguments switch modes | Master skills, supporting lanes, documented mode switches | Full internal prompt contracts or exhaustive implementation detail |
| Repo doc | Preserve operational and product truth for contributors | Scope, commands, artifacts, current workflow | Marketing-only claims without execution relevance |
| Decision contract | Govern future implementation and audits | Metadata, evidence, scope, dependencies | Loose brainstorming or backlog items |
| Pillar page | Own a broad semantic topic | Definition, use cases, links to supporting pages | Thin overview without links |
| Supporting article | Answer a focused question or use case | Specific angle, examples, link to pillar | Duplicate the pillar |
| FAQ entry | Resolve a precise objection or question | Direct answer, caveat, next step | Long essay answer |

## Repurposing Rules

- Use `shipglowz_data/editorial/content-map.md` before choosing where repurposed content should go.
- Use `shipglowz_data/editorial/` after this map when a change affects public content, page intent, public claims, Astro runtime content, or blog/article output.
- Treat `README.md`, `shipglowz_data/business/product.md`, `shipglowz_data/branding/branding.md`, and `shipglowz_data/business/gtm.md` as claim boundaries for public content.
- Treat `shipglowz_data/editorial/claim-register.md` as the register for sensitive public claims.
- Treat `shipglowz_data/editorial/page-intent-map.md` as the route-level intent map for public Astro pages.
- Treat `shipglowz_data/editorial/astro-content-schema-policy.md` as the rule for runtime content schema preservation.
- Use `site/src/pages/docs.astro` when the repurposed idea changes how ShipGlowz documentation should be understood publicly.
- Use `site/src/content/skills/` when the repurposed idea explains a reusable skill workflow.
- Do not translate `site/src/content/skills/*.md` by default during locale work. The surrounding site UI may be localized, but skill bodies remain English unless the work explicitly includes a policy change for agent-facing contract language.
- Use `README.md` or `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md` when the change affects the canonical internal doctrine.
- Use the declared `articles` collection and `/blog` routes for new indexed editorial articles.
- Use existing declared standalone editorial article routes under `site/src/pages/` when the topic already maps to one of them.
- Report `surface missing: blog` only when the requested output does not fit either the declared blog collection or an existing standalone editorial route.

| Content lifecycle or repurposing output | `sg-content`, `shipglowz_data/editorial/content-map.md`, `shipglowz_data/editorial/`, target content surface, evidence ledger from `sg-repurpose` |

## Open Gaps

- [ ] No newsletter or social publishing repository surface is declared yet.
- [ ] Every project with products should maintain a governed product inventory, and every product with marketing or conversion intent should additionally declare canonical sales/product/demo/checkout surfaces inside its own corpus.
- [ ] Product claims should be validated against source truth, live surfaces, and proof assets before being marked complete.
