# Claim Register

## Purpose

This register gives agents a safe boundary for sensitive public claims. It does not list every sentence in the site. It lists claim families that need evidence, careful wording, or a stop condition.

## Claim Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `allowed` | Supported by current reviewed contracts and visible repository behavior |
| `allowed with caveat` | Publish only with the stated constraint or scope |
| `needs proof` | Can be explored, but not presented as fact until evidence exists |
| `claim mismatch` | Conflicts with a current contract or implementation truth |
| `blocked` | Must not be published without an explicit product/business/security decision |

## Sensitive Claim Families

| Claim family | Allowed wording boundary | Evidence source | Status | Surfaces | Stop condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Security | ShipGlowz can say it uses explicit contracts, validation, and public/private documentation boundaries to reduce accidental drift. It must not imply guaranteed security or vulnerability prevention. | `GUIDELINES.md`, `docs/technical/public-site-and-content-runtime.md`, current workflow docs | `allowed with caveat` | README, docs, FAQ, landing | Block claims of guaranteed security, zero leaks, or compliance certification |
| Privacy | ShipGlowz can describe avoiding publication of private URLs, credentials, tokens, sensitive logs, and internal-only details. It must not claim privacy compliance or data protection guarantees. | `GUIDELINES.md`, public/private boundary docs | `allowed with caveat` | Docs, FAQ, remote MCP guide | Block compliance-style privacy claims without reviewed legal/security evidence |
| Compliance | ShipGlowz has no compliance program claim. | No reviewed compliance contract | `blocked` | Any public surface | Block SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, enterprise compliance, or audit-ready claims |
| AI reliability | ShipGlowz can say it reduces ambiguity, strengthens handoffs, and gives agents clearer contracts. It must not promise agent correctness or fully autonomous reliability. | `PRODUCT.md`, `BRANDING.md`, `shipglowz-spec-driven-workflow.md` | `allowed with caveat` | Landing, skills, FAQ, docs | Block guaranteed correctness, autonomous genius, or "agents always know what to do" claims |
| Decision quality | ShipGlowz can say it directs agents to prioritize correctness, security posture, maintainability, relevant performance, and proof before speed, cost, or convenience. It must not imply guaranteed code quality, guaranteed security, or measured performance improvement without proof. | `skills/references/decision-quality-contract.md`, `shipglowz-spec-driven-workflow.md`, `README.md` | `allowed with caveat` | Landing, docs, FAQ, skills, why-not-prompts | Block "maximum security", "maximum performance", "bug-free", "always best practice", or quantified gains without evidence |
| Automation | ShipGlowz can say it orchestrates workflows and provides skills for execution, verification, docs, audits, and ship preparation. It must not imply unattended production shipping without gates. | `PRODUCT.md`, `specs/sg-build-autonomous-master-skill.md`, skill contracts | `allowed with caveat` | Skills hub, docs, README | Block "hands-free shipping" unless the exact gate sequence and limitations are stated |
| Speed | ShipGlowz can say it reduces context reconstruction and handoff overhead. It must not state quantified speed gains without measured evidence. | `BUSINESS.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, repo workflow design | `needs proof` for numbers; `allowed with caveat` for qualitative wording | Landing, pricing, FAQ | Block percentage/time-saved claims without measurement |
| Savings | ShipGlowz can discuss lower ambiguity and fewer weak handoffs. It must not claim cost savings or revenue impact without proof. | `BUSINESS.md`, `GTM.md` | `needs proof` | Pricing, landing | Block cost reduction, revenue lift, or ROI claims without data |
| Availability | ShipGlowz can describe local tools and server operations, but must not claim service uptime, hosted availability, or SLA. | Runtime docs and current repo | `blocked` for SLA; `allowed with caveat` for local behavior | Pricing, docs, README | Block uptime, SLA, or hosted reliability claims |
| Pricing | ShipGlowz can describe pricing as a hypothesis and state there is no final business model yet. It must not present packages as live offers unless a pricing decision exists. | `BUSINESS.md`, `GTM.md`, `site/src/pages/pricing.astro` | `allowed with caveat` | Pricing page, homepage pricing component, FAQ | Block fixed price, payment availability, or plan comparison claims without a reviewed pricing decision |
| Business outcomes | ShipGlowz can say it is designed for solo founders who want less ambiguity and stronger handoffs. It must not promise market success, launch success, or business growth. | `BUSINESS.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `GTM.md` | `allowed with caveat` | Landing, FAQ, docs | Block guaranteed launch, revenue, growth, or conversion claims |

## Claim Impact Plan

Use this format when a public claim is added, removed, or materially changed:

```markdown
## Claim Impact Plan

- Claim: `[exact or paraphrased claim]`
- Claim family: `[security|privacy|compliance|AI reliability|automation|speed|savings|availability|pricing|business outcome|other]`
- Affected surfaces: `[files/routes]`
- Evidence: `[contract, spec, behavior, source, or missing proof]`
- Status: `[allowed|allowed with caveat|needs proof|claim mismatch|blocked]`
- Allowed wording: `[safe wording or restriction]`
- Required action: `[publish|downgrade|mark pending proof|remove|block]`
- Stop condition: `[what must be resolved before close/ship]`
```

## Review Rules

- If the wording sounds stronger than the evidence, downgrade it.
- If a claim depends on a future feature, label it as future or do not publish it.
- If a claim would affect trust, money, safety, security, privacy, compliance, or user expectations, produce a Claim Impact Plan.
- If a public claim conflicts with `BUSINESS.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `BRANDING.md`, or `GTM.md`, mark it `claim mismatch`.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this register when product scope, business model, GTM proof, brand claim boundaries, pricing, security posture, or public promise language changes.
