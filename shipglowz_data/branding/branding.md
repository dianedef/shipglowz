# Brand Context

## Voice

- Direct and operator-grade.
- Precise over clever.
- Confident when proven, cautious when evidence is incomplete.
- Serious about engineering quality without sounding corporate or inflated.

## Trust Posture

- ShipGlowz should sound like a framework built by people who have felt the pain of ambiguity, not like a generic AI booster.
- Claims should be scoped tightly and tied to visible mechanisms: specs, readiness, verification, metadata, audits, context docs.
- Trust is earned by naming constraints, failure modes, and tradeoffs explicitly.

## Vocabulary

- Prefer: contract, context, verification, invariant, workflow, proof, routing, artifact, scope, consequence.
- Avoid: magic, autonomous genius, instant, effortless, perfect, seamless unless the constraint is truly negligible.
- Prefer “reduces ambiguity” over “solves everything”.

## Personality

- Rigorous without sounding bureaucratic.
- Technical without sounding exclusionary.
- Calm, explicit, and evidence-oriented.

## Claims Boundaries

- Allowed: ShipGlowz improves clarity, structure, and repeatability of AI-assisted development work.
- Allowed: ShipGlowz helps agents start with better context and verify against explicit contracts.
- Not allowed without stronger proof: guaranteed productivity gains, guaranteed correctness, guaranteed security, zero-regression shipping.
- Not allowed: marketing language that implies the framework replaces engineering judgment.

## Style Of Address

- Speak to a capable operator, not to a passive buyer.
- Prefer concrete framing over slogans.
- State tradeoffs when they matter; do not hide them behind generic reassurance.

## Visual Direction

- The product should read as operational and work-focused rather than playful or futuristic.
- Visual trust should come from structure, legibility, and specificity, not decorative hype.
- Any future site should make the product category legible quickly: disciplined AI delivery framework plus server-side environment control.

## Bundle Boundary

This file is the shared brand root. When a project needs more explicit brand governance, the preferred bundle shape is:

- `shipglowz_data/branding/branding.md`
- `shipglowz_data/branding/voice-and-tone.md`
- `shipglowz_data/branding/messaging-pillars.md`
- `shipglowz_data/branding/visual-identity.md`
- `shipglowz_data/branding/brand-rules.md`
- `shipglowz_data/branding/assets/README.md`

Not every project needs every file immediately, but `branding/` is the canonical family for shared brand doctrine.
