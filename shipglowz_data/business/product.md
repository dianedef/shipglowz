# Product Context

## Target User

- A solo founder who already ships code and feels the pain of context loss, unreliable prompts, and weak handoffs.
- An autonomous builder who wants AI help without downgrading execution standards.

## Problem

- Fresh agent threads repeatedly pay a context reconstruction tax.
- The main pain is not only slow coding. It is lost context and weak handoffs between the founder and the agents.
- Product intent, business assumptions, docs, and code changes drift apart easily.
- Technical checks alone do not prove that user-facing behavior or workflow integrity still holds.

## Desired Outcomes

- A fresh agent can find the right context quickly.
- A founder can hand work to an agent with less ambiguity and less re-explanation.
- Non-trivial work is shaped before coding through explicit contracts.
- Success and failure behavior are made observable and testable.
- Verification catches contract drift instead of just syntax or lint errors.

## Product Principles

- Reduce ambiguity before increasing automation.
- Prefer explicit contracts over hidden conventions.
- Keep fast paths for local work, but force structure when the task becomes risky or cross-cutting.
- Make success and failure visible to the operator.

## Core Workflows

- Explore -> Spec -> Ready -> Start -> Verify -> End.
- Fix-first path for bounded bugs.
- Docs and metadata path for keeping context and decision artifacts consistent.
- Content map and sg-repurpose path for turning product work or source ideas into faithful docs, marketing, landing-page, FAQ, and semantic-cluster material.
- Server environment lifecycle path for deploy, restart, publish, and health management.

## Scope In

- Workflow governance for AI-assisted engineering work.
- Context routing and artifact-based execution.
- Server-hosted environment management for developer workflows.
- A unified operating model between AI delivery and server environment management.

## Scope Out

- General-purpose product management suite.
- Beginner no-code workflow tooling.
- Broad cloud hosting abstraction for every deployment model.
- Generic platform-manager positioning without a strong agent-workflow angle.

## Success Signals

- Reduced need to re-explain the same repo facts in fresh threads.
- Less context loss and fewer failed handoffs in real agent-assisted delivery work.
- Specs and docs become usable contracts rather than passive notes.
- Workflow-critical changes are less likely to ship with silent success, silent failure, or stale docs.
- A founder can move from repo state to executable change with less manual framing overhead.
- Content and documentation updates are routed through a known content map instead of being rediscovered in each conversation.
- Declared products are kept coherent through a governed product inventory, public-surface mapping, and evidence-backed claim handling instead of scattered ad hoc notes.

## Risks

- The product can become too broad if the CLI and workflow framework are not presented as one coherent operating model.
- The tool can be mistaken for “just a PM2 server script with helpers” if the AI framing layer is underexplained.
- The tool can be mistaken for “just a prompting method” if the environment-delivery layer is underexplained.
- Documentation volume can grow faster than its clarity if doc roles are not kept exclusive.
- Content repurposing can drift into generic marketing if `shipglowz_data/editorial/content-map.md`, `shipglowz_data/business/product.md`, `shipglowz_data/branding/branding.md`, and `shipglowz_data/business/gtm.md` are not kept current.
