# GTM Context

## Target Segment

- Solo founders who already feel the pain of weak AI execution loops.
- Small technical teams that want stronger delivery discipline without turning the workflow into a heavy process stack.
- Autonomous technical users who want stronger delivery discipline rather than generic AI enthusiasm.

## Offer

- ShipGlowz should be presented as a unified framework for reliable AI-assisted software delivery and simple server operations.
- The offer is stronger when framed around reduced ambiguity, explicit contracts, better verification, and stronger handoffs, not raw coding speed.
- The first public story should stay simple: ShipGlowz helps solo founders ship with agents without losing context.
- Small teams should still be able to recognize themselves in the product, but as a secondary audience rather than the lead headline.

## Positioning

- Not “another coding assistant”.
- Not “just a server CLI with PM2 helpers”.
- Not “just a methodology or a bundle of prompts for agents”.
- Not a general-purpose PaaS or platform manager.
- Best current positioning: a unified framework between AI delivery and server environment management for solo founders, with clear applicability to small technical teams.

## Channels

- Technical documentation and examples.
- Content explaining spec-first execution, observability of success/failure, and artifact-based workflow design.
- Demonstrations of fresh-thread onboarding and reduced context rebuild cost.
- Founder-facing content around clarity and shipping without fragile agent loops.

## Conversion Path

- First contact through docs, examples, or technical content.
- Interest through the concrete mechanics: `AGENT.md`, `shipglowz_data/technical/context.md`, `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/`, verification, lintable metadata.
- Conversion through confidence that the framework improves reliability of real work, not toy demos.
- The buying motion should stay simple and compatible with a solo-founder audience.
- The public story should make clear that declared products, sales surfaces, and public claims are governed with explicit proof rather than improvised copy.

## Proof Points

- Dedicated context layer for fresh agents.
- Clear routing toward business, product, GTM, architecture, and guidelines.
- Spec, readiness, start, verify workflow.
- Observable success/error behavior discipline.
- Metadata-linted documentation contracts.
- Audit and verification skills built into the same framework.
- Real server operations tooling in the same operating model.
- Product governance for declared products: inventory, sales surfaces, delivery paths, and claim coherence.

## Objections

- “This looks heavier than just prompting harder.”
- “Is this a methodology or an actual product?”
- “Is this just a server script plus a few helpers?”
- “Do I need all the docs before I get value?”
- “Is this only for Bash/server-heavy repos?”

## KPIs

- To be defined once there is an explicit site and funnel.
- Early candidate signals: activated repos, repeated use of spec/verify loop, reduction in context-restatement, docs adoption across projects.
- Business model is not defined yet; pricing and revenue KPIs remain open hypotheses.

## Evidence Limits

- The current GTM contract is reviewed enough to guide wording and funnel experiments.
- It is not reviewed enough to justify aggressive commercial claims or mature revenue assumptions.
