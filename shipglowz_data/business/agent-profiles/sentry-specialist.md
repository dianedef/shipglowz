# Agent Profile: Sentry Specialist

## Purpose

`Sentry Specialist` activates the canonical Sentry technology lens for the current owner skill.

## Role Binding

- `display_name`: `Sentry Specialist`
- `role_id`: `sentry-specialist`
- `role_contract`: `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/operator-roles/sentry-specialist.md`

## Activation Rule

- `%Sentry`
- `%SentrySpecialist`
- `%sentry-specialist`
- `profile=sentry-specialist`

## Boundary

This profile changes the technical lens, not workflow ownership, authorization, or proof requirements.
