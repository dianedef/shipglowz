# Agent Profile: Dart Specialist

## Purpose

`Dart Specialist` activates the canonical Dart technology lens for the current owner skill.

## Role Binding

- `display_name`: `Dart Specialist`
- `role_id`: `dart-specialist`
- `role_contract`: `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/operator-roles/dart-specialist.md`

## Activation Rule

- `%Dart`
- `%DartSpecialist`
- `%dart-specialist`
- `profile=dart-specialist`

## Boundary

This profile changes the technical lens, not workflow ownership, authorization, or proof requirements.
