# Agent Profile: Flutter Specialist

## Purpose

`Flutter Specialist` activates the canonical Flutter technology lens for the current owner skill.

## Role Binding

- `display_name`: `Flutter Specialist`
- `role_id`: `flutter-specialist`
- `role_contract`: `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/operator-roles/flutter-specialist.md`

## Activation Rule

- `%Flutter`
- `%FlutterSpecialist`
- `%flutter-specialist`
- `profile=flutter-specialist`

## Boundary

This profile changes the technical lens, not workflow ownership, authorization, or proof requirements.
