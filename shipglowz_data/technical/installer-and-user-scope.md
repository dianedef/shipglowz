# Installer And User Scope

## Purpose

This doc covers `cli/install.sh` and the root/user boundary for ShipGlowz setup. Read it before changing system dependencies, global binaries, aliases, skill links, Codex/Claude config, MCP registration, or project-local `shipglowz_data` bootstrap behavior.

## Owned Files

| Path | Role | Edit notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cli/install.sh` | Root-level server bootstrap and per-user setup | Preserve idempotence and explicit root-only behavior |
| `tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh` | Shared Claude/Codex skill symlink sync helper | Reuse instead of duplicating skill-link repair logic |
| `README.md` | Operator install contract | Update when commands, privilege, or installed tooling changes |
| `local/install.sh`, `local/install_local.ps1` | Workstation-side setup | Keep separate from root server install assumptions |
| `.env.example` | Example configuration | Keep secrets as placeholders only |

## Entrypoints

- `curl -fsSL https://shipflowzsite.vercel.app/shipflow-script | sudo sh`: short remote bootstrap. It clones or updates `~/shipflow` for the invoking sudo user, stashes local dirty repo changes before updating, then delegates to `~/shipflow/cli/install.sh`.
- `install-shipglowz.sh`: raw bootstrap script used by the short remote endpoint.
- `sudo ./cli/install.sh`: server installer.
- `configure_command_wrappers`: installs global `shipflow`, `sf`, and helper command symlinks such as `shipflow-turso-login` and `shipflow-turso-ssh`.
- `setup_user`: per-user configuration for eligible users.
- `resolve_install_components`: interactive or env-driven selector for user-space agents (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `kilocode`), ShipGlowz runtime config, and TUI.
- `configure_*_mcp`: Claude/Codex MCP provider setup. Codex MCP entries
  are registered disabled by default and enabled per session by the ShipGlowz
  launcher.
- `configure_skills`: delegates skill symlink check/repair to `tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh`.
- `configure_aliases`, `configure_data`: user workflow setup.

## Control Flow

```text
curl -fsSL https://shipflowzsite.vercel.app/shipflow-script | sudo sh
  -> install git/curl/bash bootstrap dependencies when missing
  -> clone or update ShipGlowz under the invoking user's home
  -> stash local dirty repo changes before update
  -> exec sudo/root cli/install.sh

sudo ./cli/install.sh
  -> verify root scope
  -> install system tools
  -> configure global commands
  -> collect eligible users
  -> resolve user-space component selection
  -> setup_user
  -> write aliases, skill links, MCP config, Codex config, shipglowz_data
  -> generate install report
```

## Invariants

- Server install is root-level and should fail clearly without root.
- The remote bootstrap must preserve the root boundary: it may prepare the repository, but the real system setup still runs through `cli/install.sh` as root.
- Daily work should run under an operational user, not by forcing all state into root.
- The installer installs the PM2 binary but must not configure PM2 boot
  autostart by default; environments should start explicitly under the
  operator user.
- The installer installs the Caddy binary for ShipGlowz use, but disables the
  default system `caddy.service`; normal environment proxying is launched later
  by ShipGlowz in user mode and tied to PM2 app lifecycle.
- Existing user config must be preserved outside ShipGlowz-managed blocks.
- User-space agent CLI install is selection-based. `claude`, `codex`,
  `opencode`, and `kilocode` may be installed independently.
- The current user-space agent install path uses `pnpm add -g` inside
  `PNPM_HOME`, so the installer follows the package registry version current at
  install time instead of shipping pinned local binaries.
- The system Node.js install path follows the current NodeSource LTS bootstrap
  (`setup_lts.x`) before installing `nodejs`; repository-managed Node surfaces
  should remain compatible with Node `22.12.0` through 24.x unless a stronger
  pin is explicitly validated.
- Symlinks and aliases should be idempotent and updated consistently. The managed bash aliases include `shipflow`/`sf`/`s`, Claude/Codex launch shortcuts, reload helpers, and `ch` for clearing the current terminal plus tmux pane history (`clear; tmux clear-history`).
- Helper command wrappers under `/usr/local/bin` should point back to scripts in
  `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT`; do not duplicate helper logic into generated files.
- ShipGlowz skill runtime entries under `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.codex/skills` are symlinks to `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/<name>`.
- Codex MCP registrations should default to `enabled = false`; normal Codex
  sessions stay lightweight, and ShipGlowz launches MCP-enabled sessions with
  temporary `-c mcp_servers.<name>.enabled=true` overrides.
- Runtime skill link repair blocks on non-symlink targets by default; installer compatibility may pass `--backup-existing` to move collisions aside explicitly.
- Installer errors should stop before partial or misleading success.
- `cli/install.sh` provides Flox/system tooling; Flutter/Dart runtimes are provisioned per project Flox environment unless the operator explicitly uses optional global SDK install.

## Failure Modes

- Live downloads or package installers can fail partially; messages must identify the failing step.
- `--only` or component-scoped install paths can leave stale aliases or symlinks if final synchronization is skipped.
- Missing runtime tools should produce direct diagnostics, not secondary shell errors.
- When only some agents are selected, verification and reporting must show
  unselected agents as intentionally skipped rather than failed.
- Missing Playwright Chromium runtime libraries can still break a
  Playwright-enabled Codex launch; the installer records the local Chromium
  path while keeping Playwright MCP disabled until explicitly requested.
- Incorrect user targeting can install private workflow config for the wrong account.

## Security Notes

- Do not paste tokens, private MCP credentials, or shell config secrets into docs.
- Treat root-level writes and `/usr/local` changes as high-impact.
- Preserve non-destructive validation paths for installer changes.

## Validation

```bash
bash -n cli/install.sh local/install.sh local/turso-login.sh local/turso-ssh.sh
bash -n tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh tests/skills/runtime-sync.sh
bash tests/skills/runtime-sync.sh
tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh --check --all
rg -n "resolve_install_components|install_ai_agent_clis_for_user|verify_ai_agent_clis_for_user|configure_aliases|configure_skills|configure_data|setup_user|collect_target_users|configure_codex|shipflow-turso-login|shipflow-turso-ssh" cli/install.sh local/
```

For behavioral changes, prefer a disposable host/container or a narrowly scoped installer dry run before claiming install success.

## Reader Checklist

- `cli/install.sh` changed -> review this doc and `README.md`.
- Alias/symlink behavior changed -> check local and server install docs, plus `tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh --check --all`.
- MCP config changed -> check provider docs references and remote login docs.
- Playwright MCP config changed -> confirm Linux ARM64 keeps using the local
  Playwright Chromium executable instead of a Google Chrome stable channel, and
  that Codex still writes the provider as disabled by default.
- User targeting changed -> check installer ownership specs.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this doc when install privilege, user targeting, package/tool list, symlink/alias behavior, MCP setup, Codex/Claude config, or `shipglowz_data` bootstrap behavior changes.
