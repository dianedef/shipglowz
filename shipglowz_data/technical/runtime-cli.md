# Runtime CLI

## Purpose

This doc covers the server-side CLI runtime: `cli/shipglowz.sh`, `cli/lib.sh`, and `cli/config.sh`. It is the first technical doc to read when changing environment lifecycle, dashboard, publishing, health, PM2, Flox, Caddy, DuckDNS, session identity, or CLI menu behavior.

## Owned Files

| Path | Role | Edit notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cli/shipglowz.sh` | Thin CLI entrypoint that sources runtime and menu files, then calls `main` | Keep thin; do not move business logic here |
| `cli/lib.sh` | Main orchestration library for UI, validation, PM2/Flox/Caddy operations, health, deploy, publish, and actions | High blast radius; prefer focused changes and syntax checks |
| `cli/shipglowz_devserver_gum.sh`, `cli/shipglowz_devserver_bash.sh` | Menu frontends that render the root menu and grouped submenus | Keep frontend behavior equivalent; update both variants together |
| `cli/config.sh` | Central configuration defaults and validation | Keep defaults explicit and validation actionable |
| `CONTEXT-FUNCTION-TREE.md` | Navigation aid for large shell files | Update when major functions or flows move |

## Entrypoints

- `shipflow` / `sf`: installed wrappers that call `cli/shipglowz.sh`.
- `cli/shipglowz.sh::main`: checks prerequisites, then starts the menu or runs a
  one-shot visible menu-key path.
- `sf codex` / `sf co`: early Codex launcher shortcut that bypasses
  environment cleanup, asks for a workspace/MCP preset when needed, then
  replaces the ShipGlowz process with `codex`.
- `cli/lib.sh::run_menu`: dispatches interactive menu choices to `action_*` handlers.
- `cli/lib.sh::run_menu_shortcut`: dispatches a single CLI menu-key argument such
  as `sf t` or a nested key path such as `sf m n` to the matching visible menu
  action. Path resolution starts in `MAIN_MENU_ITEMS`, then continues through
  grouped submenu item arrays when the selected action opens a nested menu.
- `cli/shipglowz_devserver_gum.sh` / `cli/shipglowz_devserver_bash.sh`: render the root menu from `MAIN_MENU_ITEMS`
  and grouped submenus from `ENVIRONMENT_MENU_ITEMS`, `TOOLS_WEB_MENU_ITEMS`,
  `SYSTEM_MENU_ITEMS`, and `AGENTS_CI_MENU_ITEMS`. Startup rendering should
  avoid per-item subprocesses; the Gum frontend should batch styling through
  one boxed render instead of one `gum style` call per item. The root menu uses
  a two-column layout on wide terminals and falls back to one column on narrow
  terminals. ShipGlowz's own tracker overview is exposed as a dedicated root
  action instead of being nested under agents.
- `cli/shipglowz_devserver_bash.sh` / `cli/shipglowz_devserver_gum.sh`: render menus and use shared key input helpers
  so `x`, `Esc`, and `Backspace` act consistently for Back.
- Nested menus render their screen title through `cli/lib.sh::ui_screen_header` and
  dispatch actions in `screen` mode so child commands do not stack under the
  parent menu.
- `cli/lib.sh` UI helpers: `ui_read_choice`, `ui_run_menu_action`,
  `ui_return_back`, and the skip-next-pause signal define the reusable
  Back/cancel contract for nested menus, including selections made through
  `$(ui_choose ...)` command substitutions.
- `cli/lib.sh::ui_run_menu_action`: centralizes menu action dispatch. Top-level
  interactive actions run in `screen` mode so command output starts from a
  clean screen instead of below the root menu, while nested menus can keep
  `inline` behavior.
- `cli/lib.sh::ui_header`: prints the main menu status header and can embed the
  session identity block inside the same top frame.
- `cli/lib.sh::ui_screen_header`: prints consistent subcommand screen headers from
  one title plus an optional variant such as `danger` or `success`.
- `cli/lib.sh::ui_box_header` (deprecated: use `ui_screen_header` or `ui_text_center`): prints fixed-width boxed CLI headers so left and
  right borders stay aligned across dashboard, logs, health, and success blocks.
- `cli/lib.sh::env_start`, `env_stop`, `env_restart`, `env_remove`: core environment lifecycle.
- `cli/lib.sh::list_pm2_app_names`, `list_all_stop_targets`, and
  `pm2_stop_app_by_name`: PM2 stop safety helpers used to stop both
  disk-discovered environments and PM2-only orphan entries.
- `cli/lib.sh::action_flutter_web`: interactive Flutter Web preview through `tmux`
  with hot reload/hot restart control.
- `cli/lib.sh::action_blacksmith_setup`: guided official-first Blacksmith setup
  screen for CLI presence, local auth status, GitHub App guidance, runner tags,
  SSH Access debugging guidance, and Testbox init commands. It prints required
  terminal commands instead of running interactive install/auth/project mutation
  steps automatically, and routes remote Blacksmith auth through the local
  tunnel menu.
- `cli/lib.sh::action_turso_setup`: guided Turso setup screen under Agents. It
  reports CLI/auth status through `turso auth whoami`, routes browser login to
  the local `urls` Turso helper, and prints ContentFlow schema-check commands
  without reading or storing Turso tokens.
- `cli/lib.sh::action_codex_launcher`: interactive Codex launcher for choosing a
  workspace and enabling selected MCP providers for the new Codex session only.
- `cli/lib.sh::action_mcp_menu`: grouped MCP/Codex menu that routes to the Codex
  launcher or the local OAuth tunnel instructions.
- `cli/lib.sh::action_github_auth`: official GitHub CLI login/status screen for
  repository listing and deploy-from-GitHub readiness. It delegates token
  handling to `gh` and must not read or store GitHub tokens.
- `cli/lib.sh::action_reboot_vm`: explicit confirmed VM reboot action from the
  system menu. It supports `SHIPFLOW_REBOOT_DRY_RUN=1` for smoke checks.
- `cli/lib.sh::mcp_cleanup_menu`: health-menu cleanup for local MCP process
  groups. It lists provider/RAM/uptime/parent Codex evidence and stops only a
  confirmed process group.
- `cli/lib.sh::action_health`: renders the system monitor with RAM, disk, swap,
  process, and PM2 health first, then uses explicit one-key actions for cleanup
  commands. It must not route destructive cleanup options through
  searchable/default-select menus.
- `cli/lib.sh::disk_cleanup_menu`: one-key disk cleanup flow for old Codex/Claude
  history files, agent caches/logs, safe dev caches, and heavier regenerated
  dev state. The light tier targets low-risk package/tool caches; the
  aggressive tier also removes large regenerated state such as Gradle caches,
  Dart analysis cache, pub cache, selected local editor/agent state, and
  common workspace artifacts (`node_modules`, `venv`, `.dart_tool`, build
  directories). It shows estimated recoverable space and protects auth,
  config, skills, memories, source trees, and recent agent histories.
- `cli/lib.sh::disk_usage_details_menu`: read-only disk usage detail view for the
  largest PM2 log files, `$HOME` entries, project/work directories, and root
  filesystem entries.
- `cli/lib.sh::cleanup_pm2_logs_with_rotation`: truncates PM2 daemon/app logs and
  configures `pm2-logrotate` (`max_size=50M`, `retain=5` by default) so PM2
  logs cannot refill the disk unchecked.
- Command submenus that can start, stop, restart, launch, or clean up runtime
  state should use explicit one-key choices or confirmations; `ui_filter_choose`
  is reserved for longer data-selection lists and flushes pending input before
  opening the filter. The shared input flush now waits for a short quiet window
  on `/dev/tty` instead of a single immediate drain so fast `key + Enter`
  sequences from one-key menus do not leak into the next searchable selector.
- `cli/lib.sh::refresh_user_caddy_from_pm2` and
  `sync_caddy_after_pm2_change`: user-mode Caddy lifecycle helpers. They write
  runtime config under the operator's `~/.shipflow/runtime/caddy`, refresh
  routes from online PM2 apps, and stop Caddy when no PM2 app is online.
- `cli/lib.sh::action_publish`: public exposure through Caddy and DuckDNS.

## Control Flow

```text
cli/shipglowz.sh
  -> source cli/lib.sh
  -> main
  -> check_prerequisites
  -> run_menu OR run_menu_shortcut
  -> action_* handler
  -> PM2 / Flox / user Caddy / optional DuckDNS side effect
```

For projects detected from `pubspec.yaml`, runtime provisioning is explicit:
- `dart` projects must ensure Dart packages in project Flox before launch.
- `flutter` projects must ensure Flutter packages in project Flox before launch.
- existing `.flox` environments are repaired idempotently for Dart/Flutter
  runtime packages before startup continues.
- runtime override variables are treated as untrusted input and validated as
  simple Flox package tokens before any `flox install` call.

Flutter Web has two runtime paths:
- PM2-managed launch remains available through the normal environment lifecycle.
- A `package.json` without a supported JS framework or exact runnable `dev` /
  `start` script must not block `pubspec.yaml` detection; mixed Flutter +
  Convex projects still use the Flutter Web command.
- Interactive preview uses `tmux` from `action_flutter_web`, starts
  `flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname 0.0.0.0 --web-port <port>` inside
  the project Flox environment, records the session in
  `SHIPFLOW_FLUTTER_WEB_SESSIONS_FILE`, and sends `r`/`R` to that session for
  hot reload or hot restart.

## Invariants

- PM2 is the execution state source.
- `invalidate_pm2_cache` must run after PM2 mutations.
- User-mode Caddy follows PM2 online state: environment start refreshes routes,
  environment stop refreshes or stops it, and Stop All stops it when no PM2 app
  remains online.
- The system Caddy service is a legacy/public HTTPS path and should not be left
  running when no PM2 app is online.
- Stop flows must cover PM2 entries even when their project directories are no
  longer resolvable from disk, then persist the stopped state with PM2.
- Generated PM2 ecosystem configs for dev servers must bound automatic restart
  loops so broken commands cannot fill logs indefinitely.
- `env_restart` must confirm that PM2 remains `online` during its stability
  window before reporting success or advertising the application's localhost
  URL.
- Project paths must be validated and absolute before runtime use.
- Port allocation must avoid active socket collisions and PM2 hidden collisions.
- User-visible success and failure should be observable.
- Project tracking initialization must keep ShipGlowz-owned `TASKS.md` under
  `SHIPFLOW_DATA_DIR` and must not create project-local `TASKS.md` symlinks.
  Legacy symlinks from older ShipGlowz versions should be removed when they
  point into `shipglowz_data`.
- Root interactive menu actions should be dispatched through
  `ui_run_menu_action` in `screen` mode; grouped submenus may use `inline` when
  they already own their screen lifecycle.
- Back/cancel paths should signal parent redraw through the shared UI helpers
  instead of returning like completed actions.
- Subcommand screen headers should use `ui_screen_header` rather than
  hand-counted rules or direct `ui_box_header` calls.
- Generated ecosystem/runtime config is not the hand-edited source of truth.
- Codex MCP providers are off by default; the runtime launcher enables selected
  providers with session-only config overrides and must not persistently flip
  `~/.codex/config.toml`.
- Dart/Flutter runtime provisioning failures must stop startup before PM2 launch.
- Flutter Web `tmux` preview sessions are interactive developer sessions, not
  PM2-managed production-like processes.

## Failure Modes

- Missing prerequisites should produce an actionable error before secondary failures.
- Unknown shortcut arguments should fail visibly with the available visible root menu keys.
- Invalid shortcut paths should fail visibly with the offending argument
  position instead of silently falling through to the interactive menu.
- Back actions should redraw the parent menu directly instead of requiring an
  extra pause keypress.
- Back/cancel state can be lost when a selector runs inside Bash command
  substitution unless the shared skip-next-pause signal is used.
- PM2 cache drift can make dashboard, health, and port decisions wrong.
- Disk-only environment discovery can miss stale PM2 entries; stop flows should
  union project-discovered environments with PM2 app names.
- Unbounded PM2 autorestart can turn a missing directory, missing dependency, or
  failing dev command into a restart storm and log growth incident.
- A successful `pm2 restart` command alone is not runtime proof: a process can
  enter `waiting restart` immediately afterwards, so the menu must report the
  failed stabilization and point to its PM2 logs.
- User-mode Caddy startup failures must not block PM2 app startup, but they must
  be visible with the runtime log path.
- Caddy/DuckDNS publishing failures must not be reported as successful public exposure.
- Broad shell parsing can misread structured state; use `jq`, Node, or existing structured helpers where available.
- Invalid Dart/Flutter package overrides (paths, shell fragments, option-like tokens) must be rejected before invoking `flox install`.
- Missing `tmux` should block only the interactive Flutter Web preview path and
  produce an actionable operator message.
- Missing Blacksmith CLI or auth should be shown as a setup status, not as a
  runtime failure; the menu must print the official next command when an
  interactive Blacksmith step is required.
- Missing Turso CLI or auth should be shown as setup status; the server menu
  should route login to local tunnel tooling instead of asking the remote shell
  to open a browser callback directly.
- Blacksmith SSH Access is an organization/GitHub user capability, not a
  ShipGlowz server install step. The runtime menu should explain where to find
  the `Setup runner` SSH command and should not attempt to write local
  workstation SSH config from the server.
- The Codex launcher should fail before `exec` when Codex is absent, a selected
  workspace is invalid, or an MCP name is malformed; it must not kill existing
  Codex conversations or MCP processes.
- MCP cleanup should target only local MCP server process groups, ask for
  confirmation, and refuse any process group that contains a `codex` process.
- Disk cleanup must not delete agent auth/config/skills/memories; history
  cleanup is retention-based. Aggressive cleanup may remove regenerated build
  artifacts inside project trees, but not source files, git data, or primary
  repository structure.
- Package-manager caches such as PNPM are disk cleanup targets, not RAM/process
  cleanup targets.
- PM2 logs can dominate disk usage; disk cleanup should expose their size, offer
  a confirmed flush, and configure rotation rather than relying on manual
  operator cleanup.

## Security Notes

- Do not log tokens, DuckDNS secrets, private paths containing credentials, or raw environment values.
- Public URL publishing is externally visible and needs explicit validation.
- Destructive actions must stay idempotent and confirmation-gated where the UX expects it.
- Blacksmith credentials are detected only by local credentials-file presence;
  the runtime must not read, print, store, or transform token contents.
- Blacksmith runner SSH diagnostics must not copy raw environment values,
  tokens, cookies, signing keys, or private headers into reports.
- Turso auth status may be checked through `turso auth whoami`; token files
  under `~/.config/turso` must not be read or printed by the runtime menu.

## Validation

```bash
bash -n cli/shipglowz.sh cli/lib.sh cli/config.sh
test_flox_runtime_provisioning.sh
rg -n "invalidate_pm2_cache" cli/lib.sh
printf 'x\n' | env SHIPFLOW_PROJECTS_DIR=/tmp/shipflow-empty ./cli/shipglowz.sh u
SHIPFLOW_CODEX_DRY_RUN=1 ./cli/shipglowz.sh codex --dir "$PWD" supabase playwright
printf 'x' | bash -lc 'source ./cli/lib.sh; action_health'
printf 'x\n' | bash -lc 'source ./cli/lib.sh; disk_cleanup_menu'
printf 'x\n' | bash -lc 'source ./cli/lib.sh; action_turso_setup'
SHIPFLOW_PM2_LOG_CLEANUP_DRY_RUN=1 bash -lc 'source ./cli/lib.sh; cleanup_pm2_logs_with_rotation'
bash -lc 'source ./cli/lib.sh; disk_usage_details_menu'
SHIPFLOW_MCP_CLEANUP_DRY_RUN=1 bash -lc 'source ./cli/lib.sh; mcp_cleanup_menu'
SHIPFLOW_USER_CADDY_DRY_RUN=1 bash -lc 'source ./cli/lib.sh; refresh_user_caddy_from_pm2'
printf 'o\n' | SHIPFLOW_REBOOT_DRY_RUN=1 bash -lc 'source ./cli/lib.sh; action_reboot_vm'
```

Run a focused runtime smoke for the touched behavior when practical, for example dashboard/status for read-only changes or a non-production test project for lifecycle changes.

## Reader Checklist

- `cli/shipglowz.sh`, `cli/lib.sh`, or `cli/config.sh` changed -> review this doc and `code-docs-map.md`.
- Function structure moved -> update `CONTEXT-FUNCTION-TREE.md`.
- User-facing CLI behavior changed -> check `README.md` and `CONTEXT.md`.
- Publish or secret handling changed -> check security notes and public docs.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this doc when runtime entrypoints, lifecycle flows, PM2/Flox/Caddy/DuckDNS behavior, validations, or security constraints change.
