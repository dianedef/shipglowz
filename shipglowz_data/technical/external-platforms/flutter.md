# Flutter Platform Note

## Sources

- https://docs.flutter.dev/
- https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes
- https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/overview

## Decision Rules

- Preserve platform parity, responsive layout, safe areas, and keyboard/IME behavior.
- Follow the project state-management and navigation conventions.
- Keep widgets focused and avoid business logic in presentation code.
- Check current breaking changes before SDK-sensitive migrations.
- Require analyzer, tests, and device/browser proof proportional to the UI change.

## Validation

Run `flutter analyze`, focused tests, and the relevant platform build or manual flow.
