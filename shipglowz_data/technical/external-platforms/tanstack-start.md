# TanStack Start Platform Note

## Purpose

Canonical ShipGlowz reference for TanStack Start full-stack React routing, server functions, rendering, data loading, and deployment adapters.

This note is a source map and decision contract, not a copy of vendor documentation.

## Source Map

- [Official source 1](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/overview)
- [Official source 2](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/server-functions)
- [Official source 3](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing)

## Freshness Gate Use

Check current official docs plus the project's installed version, lockfile, configuration, and local usage note before making version-sensitive, security-sensitive, or deployment-sensitive claims.

## ShipGlowz Decision Rules

- Keep this reference-only and recheck maturity before each adoption decision.
- Do not standardize it without a project-specific advantage over the current Astro/React stack.
- Keep server-only code, secrets, and client bundles strictly separated.
- Check adapter, deployment, caching, and server-function behavior against current docs.
- Require a migration and maintenance-cost comparison before replacing an established framework.

## Security Notes

- Never persist tokens, credentials, private payloads, cookies, customer data, or raw provider logs in governance artifacts.
- Treat external tools, webhooks, database access, and deployment bindings as scoped capabilities.

## Validation

Run typecheck, tests, build, target-adapter proof, and browser checks for routing, data loading, server functions, and hydration.

## Reader Checklist

- identify the actual project version and runtime
- load the governance-root usage note when local behavior matters
- separate official behavior, local evidence, and inference
- record `fresh-docs checked`, `gap`, or `conflict`

## Maintenance Rule

Update this note when TanStack Start changes APIs, compatibility, deployment, security, migration, or runtime behavior that affects ShipGlowz decisions.
