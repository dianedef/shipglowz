# Sentry Platform Note

## Purpose

This note is the global ShipGlowz/Chiclou cheat sheet for Sentry-related freshness checks. Use it before relying on assumptions about SDK setup, environments, releases, source maps, Debug IDs, issue/event evidence, alerts, monitors, Session Replay, PII scrubbing, or production incident proof.

It does not replace Sentry documentation. It records the source map and ShipGlowz rules agents should use before changing observability code, deploy proof, release correlation, or project-local Sentry usage docs.

## Source Map

Primary sources for Freshness Gate:

| Need | Source |
| --- | --- |
| JavaScript SDK environment option | https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/environments/ |
| Debug IDs and source map association | https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/ember/sourcemaps/troubleshooting_js/debug-ids |
| Release API | https://docs.sentry.io/api/releases/create-a-new-release-for-an-organization/ |
| JavaScript data collected / PII considerations | https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/data-management/data-collected |
| Monitors & Alerts API | https://docs.sentry.io/api/monitors/ |
| Monitors & Alerts changelog | https://sentry.io/changelog/monitors--alerts--now-generally-available/ |
| JavaScript docs index for agents | https://sentrydocs.dev/llms.txt |

Freshness evidence on 2026-05-24:

- Sentry JavaScript environment docs state environments identify where an error occurred and are case-sensitive with naming constraints.
- Sentry Debug ID docs describe Debug IDs as the recommended reliable way to associate minified JavaScript with source maps, using Sentry CLI or bundler plugins.
- Sentry release API docs describe releases as useful for correlating first-seen events with the release that introduced them and for source maps/debug features requiring manual upload.
- JavaScript data-collection docs describe default privacy behavior and note that query strings, breadcrumbs, request data, Session Replay, and console messages may contain PII depending on configuration.
- Sentry changelog announced Monitors & Alerts as generally available, with alert routing separated from monitor configuration.

## Freshness Gate Use

Use `fresh-docs checked` for Sentry decisions only after checking relevant Sentry docs and local project instrumentation/deploy evidence.

Use `fresh-docs gap` when:

- Runtime proof depends on Sentry but no issue/event/release/environment pointer is available.
- Source maps, Debug IDs, releases, or build upload config are changed without checking current Sentry docs and local CI secrets.
- Monitoring/alerting changes rely on deprecated Issue Alert/Metric Alert assumptions instead of current Monitors & Alerts behavior.
- A project uses Sentry but lacks `shipglowz_data/technical/platforms/sentry.md`.

Use `fresh-docs conflict` when current Sentry docs contradict local docs, alert assumptions, release assumptions, or planned instrumentation.

## ShipGlowz Decision Rules

- Sentry evidence is a pointer, not raw payload material. Reports should reference redacted issue/event/release/environment facts, not paste sensitive telemetry.
- Configure environment and release/dist/build identity consistently so preview/prod incidents can be correlated.
- For JavaScript, prefer modern source map/Debug ID upload through official Sentry tooling or bundler integration when available.
- Keep Sentry auth tokens in CI/secret managers only. Do not commit `.env.sentry-build-plugin` or equivalent.
- Treat Session Replay, breadcrumbs, console logs, query strings, request bodies, headers, and tags as PII leak surfaces.
- Monitors own detection; Alerts own routing. Do not conflate monitor configuration with notification routing.
- Missing Sentry evidence is a proof gap, not proof of no runtime error.

## Common Project-Local Fields

A project using Sentry should maintain `<governance-root>/shipglowz_data/technical/platforms/sentry.md` with:

- Sentry project/org slug, if safe
- SDK/framework and package versions
- DSN env var name, never secret values
- environment/release/dist naming policy
- source map/Debug ID upload route and CI secret names
- replay, breadcrumbs, logs, PII scrubbing, and sampling policy
- monitor/alert ownership
- issue/event evidence route for `sg-prod`, `sg-fix`, and `sg-verify`

Use `templates/artifacts/project_platform_usage.md` as the starter structure.

## Security Notes

- Never store Sentry auth tokens, raw event payloads, breadcrumbs, replay contents, headers, cookies, auth codes, private URLs, or PII in ShipGlowz docs.
- Treat Sentry DSNs as public-ish project identifiers, not auth secrets, but avoid publishing them unnecessarily.
- Before enabling richer telemetry, verify scrubbing and sampling.
- Source maps should support debugging without exposing source maps publicly after upload unless the project explicitly accepts that risk.

## Validation

```bash
python3 tools/shipglowz_metadata_lint.py shipglowz_data/technical/external-platforms/sentry.md
rg -n "Freshness Gate|Source Map|ShipGlowz Decision Rules|Maintenance Rule" shipglowz_data/technical/external-platforms/sentry.md
```

## Reader Checklist

- `Sentry.init`, `SENTRY_`, source map upload, replay, breadcrumbs, monitor, alert, issue ID, or event ID found -> check for project-local Sentry usage note.
- Runtime failure/debug task -> ask for or locate redacted Sentry issue/event/release/environment evidence.
- Build/deploy pipeline changed -> verify release/source map/Debug ID upload.
- Observability policy changed -> verify PII, replay, breadcrumbs, and alert routing.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this note when Sentry SDK, environment/release, source map/Debug ID, data collection, Replay, Monitors & Alerts, or ShipGlowz incident-proof rules change.
