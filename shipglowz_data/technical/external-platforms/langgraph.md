# LangGraph Platform Note

## Purpose

Canonical ShipGlowz reference for stateful graph-based agent workflows, persistence, checkpoints, interrupts, and durable execution.

This note is a source map and decision contract, not a copy of vendor documentation.

## Source Map

- [Official source 1](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview)
- [Official source 2](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)
- [Official source 3](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/durable-execution)

## Freshness Gate Use

Check current official docs plus the project's installed version, lockfile, configuration, and local usage note before making version-sensitive, security-sensitive, or deployment-sensitive claims.

## ShipGlowz Decision Rules

- Keep this reference-only until a project needs durable graph execution.
- Use it for explicit state machines and resumable workflows, not ordinary sequential functions.
- Document checkpoint storage, tenancy, retention, replay, and deletion.
- Make side effects idempotent before enabling retries or resume.
- Do not mix LangGraph and CrewAI without a documented ownership boundary.

## Security Notes

- Never persist tokens, credentials, private payloads, cookies, customer data, or raw provider logs in governance artifacts.
- Treat external tools, webhooks, database access, and deployment bindings as scoped capabilities.

## Validation

Test graph transitions, invalid state, interruption/resume, duplicate execution, persistence isolation, and tool failures.

## Reader Checklist

- identify the actual project version and runtime
- load the governance-root usage note when local behavior matters
- separate official behavior, local evidence, and inference
- record `fresh-docs checked`, `gap`, or `conflict`

## Maintenance Rule

Update this note when LangGraph changes APIs, compatibility, deployment, security, migration, or runtime behavior that affects ShipGlowz decisions.
