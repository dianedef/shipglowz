# PydanticAI Platform Note

## Purpose

Canonical ShipGlowz reference for typed Python agent applications, structured outputs, tools, dependencies, and model-provider boundaries.

This note is a source map and decision contract, not a copy of vendor documentation.

## Source Map

- [Official source 1](https://ai.pydantic.dev/)
- [Official source 2](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/)
- [Official source 3](https://ai.pydantic.dev/output/)
- [Official source 4](https://ai.pydantic.dev/tools/)

## Freshness Gate Use

Check current official docs plus the project's installed version, lockfile, configuration, and local usage note before making version-sensitive, security-sensitive, or deployment-sensitive claims.

## ShipGlowz Decision Rules

- Keep this reference-only until recurring project adoption justifies a specialist role.
- Prefer typed dependencies and structured outputs over ad hoc parsing.
- Treat tools as permission boundaries with validated inputs and bounded side effects.
- Check provider, Pydantic, and Python compatibility from the actual project lockfile.
- Use deterministic Python when an agent loop adds no material value.

## Security Notes

- Never persist tokens, credentials, private payloads, cookies, customer data, or raw provider logs in governance artifacts.
- Treat external tools, webhooks, database access, and deployment bindings as scoped capabilities.

## Validation

Run type checks and focused tests for output validation, tool failures, provider errors, and unsafe input boundaries.

## Reader Checklist

- identify the actual project version and runtime
- load the governance-root usage note when local behavior matters
- separate official behavior, local evidence, and inference
- record `fresh-docs checked`, `gap`, or `conflict`

## Maintenance Rule

Update this note when PydanticAI changes APIs, compatibility, deployment, security, migration, or runtime behavior that affects ShipGlowz decisions.
