# JavaScript Platform Note

## Sources

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide
- https://tc39.es/ecma262/

## Decision Rules

- Respect the declared runtime, module format, and browser/server boundary.
- Handle async failures and resource cleanup explicitly.
- Avoid implicit coercion and mutation when they obscure behavior.
- Prefer platform APIs supported by the actual target runtime.
- Validate behavior with lint, tests, and the relevant runtime/build.

## Validation

Use project scripts and test runtime-visible behavior; syntax or bundling alone is insufficient for async, DOM, or network paths.
