# TypeScript Platform Note

## Sources

- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/overview.html

## Decision Rules

- Respect the project `tsconfig` and framework build contract.
- Prefer explicit domain types and narrowing over unsafe assertions.
- Treat generated types and provider SDK types as owned boundaries.
- Run the project typecheck; transpilation alone is not type proof.
- Check current release notes before relying on recently introduced syntax or compiler behavior.

## Validation

Use the project package manager and declared typecheck/build scripts. Add focused tests when runtime behavior is not proven by types.
