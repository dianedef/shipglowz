# Turso Platform Note

## Purpose

Canonical ShipGlowz reference for Turso Cloud, embedded Turso/libSQL, CLI authentication, schema proof, replicas, and MCP boundaries.

This note is a source map and decision contract, not a copy of vendor documentation.

## Source Map

- [Official source 1](https://docs.turso.tech/introduction)
- [Official source 2](https://docs.turso.tech/cli/introduction)
- [Official source 3](https://docs.turso.tech/cli/authentication)
- [Official source 4](https://docs.turso.tech/cli/db/shell)
- [Official source 5](https://docs.turso.tech/tursodb/quickstart)

## Freshness Gate Use

Check current official docs plus the project's installed version, lockfile, configuration, and local usage note before making version-sensitive, security-sensitive, or deployment-sensitive claims.

## ShipGlowz Decision Rules

- Distinguish hosted Turso Cloud CLI operations from embedded/local database behavior.
- Use the official Cloud CLI for authoritative hosted schema proof; do not substitute local MCP inspection.
- Keep auth tokens and database credentials out of docs, logs, prompts, and broad MCP configuration.
- Prefer project-local dependency and migration contracts; verify libSQL/SQLite compatibility explicitly.
- Require backups and an explicit mutation scope before destructive hosted database operations.

## Security Notes

- Never persist tokens, credentials, private payloads, cookies, customer data, or raw provider logs in governance artifacts.
- Treat external tools, webhooks, database access, and deployment bindings as scoped capabilities.

## Validation

Check the local package/CLI version, authentication status without printing tokens, project migrations, and focused hosted or local database proof.

## Reader Checklist

- identify the actual project version and runtime
- load the governance-root usage note when local behavior matters
- separate official behavior, local evidence, and inference
- record `fresh-docs checked`, `gap`, or `conflict`

## Maintenance Rule

Update this note when Turso changes APIs, compatibility, deployment, security, migration, or runtime behavior that affects ShipGlowz decisions.
