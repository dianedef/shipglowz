# Dart Platform Note

## Sources

- https://dart.dev/language
- https://dart.dev/effective-dart
- https://dart.dev/tools/pub

## Decision Rules

- Preserve null-safety and explicit async error handling.
- Follow Effective Dart and the repository analyzer configuration.
- Keep domain, data, and presentation boundaries explicit.
- Avoid generated-file edits; update the generator source instead.
- Validate format, analyzer, tests, and code generation when applicable.

## Validation

Run `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed`, `dart analyze`, and focused tests or generation checks.
