# Focus Tags Cheatsheet

Use focus tags when you want to recenter the agent fast without launching a whole new skill just to restate doctrine.

These tags are lightweight conversation cues. They do not replace owner-skill routing. They tell ShipGlowz which contract to reload before it answers, routes, edits, or verifies.

## Business Recenter Tags

Use these when you want the agent to think like a business partner instead of a neutral code mechanic.

| Tag | Use when you want... | Canonical source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#partner` | a business-partner stance, more initiative, and less passive assistant behavior | `skills/references/operator-partnership-contract.md` |
| `#growth` | growth, distribution, conversion, leverage, and GTM usefulness to dominate the decision | `shipglowz_data/business/gtm.md` |

| `#acquisition` | acquisition-channel choice, source quality, funnel entry, and measurable learning | `skills/references/operator-roles/traffic-manager.md` |
| `#offer` | the offer, promise, packaging, and commercial clarity to dominate the decision | `shipglowz_data/business/gtm.md` |

| `#portfolio` | scan the pitch links index for the best cross-project opportunity | `shipglowz_data/business/portfolio-project-pitch-links.md` |

Short usage note: use `#pitch` for one project’s identity, and `#portfolio` when you want the wider portfolio view before answering.

## Content Recenter Tags

## Execution Discipline Tags

Use these when you want to tighten how the agent executes, not just what it optimizes for.

## System Recenter Tags

Use these when the current conversation risks drifting toward the wrong repository or the wrong abstraction layer.

| Tag | Use when you want... | Canonical source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#shipflow` | the internal ShipGlowz system, not the current project repo | `skills/references/entrypoint-routing.md` |
| `#shupflow` | the same thing as `#shipflow`, with a typo-tolerant fast alias | `skills/references/entrypoint-routing.md` |
| `#shipflow-core` | ShipGlowz hardening, execution fidelity, or internal doctrine work | `skills/900-shipglowz-core/SKILL.md` |

## Technical Navigation Hint Tags

Use these when you want the agent to treat a word as an indexed technical feature term before broad search.

| Tag | Use when you want... | Canonical source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#feature:<term>` | explicit behavior-index navigation for a technical term while keeping the free-text request active; for example, `#feature:swipe` | `skills/references/entrypoint-routing.md` |

## Recommended Combos

Use these when you do not want to build the tag set from scratch.

| Goal | Recommended tags | Use when you want... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Make the offer clearer | `#offer #cta #clarity` | the page or message to make the value proposition and next action obvious |
| Push growth instead of local optimization | `#partner #growth #roi` | the agent to choose the highest-leverage move, not the easiest technical move |
| Choose an acquisition bet | `#traffic #acquisition #funnel` | the agent to rank channels by qualified intent, landing fit, and measurement readiness |
| Improve onboarding and real usability | `#end-user #clarity #quality` | the solution to become easier to understand, safer, and more useful for normal users |
| Fix objection-heavy copy | `#faq #trust #clarity` | the message to answer doubts directly without sounding slippery |
| Improve discoverability | `#seo-intent #pillar #distribution` | the content or structure to align better with search intent and distribution paths |
| Classify a source before acting | `#source #audience #cta` | an email, URL, transcript, note, or example to be sorted into the right project, angle, and owner skill |
| Classify a source across projects | `#source #portfolio #audience` | the source could fit several projects and should be matched against the portfolio pitch index first |
| Reuse cached private context | `#source #private-memory #portfolio` | the source or project pitch should be matched against the approved private cache instead of refetching public URLs |
| Rework content from an existing source | `#repurpose #audience #cta` | one source to be turned into the right surface for the right reader and action |
| Recenter on business buyer logic | `#decision-maker #offer #monetization` | the work to speak to the approver, the budget owner, or the buyer |
| Recenter on the founder perspective | `#founder #growth #clarity` | the work to assume business-owner responsibility and optimize for useful decisions |
| Recenter on your portfolio view | `#shipflow-owner #partner #no-drift` | the work to arbitrate across ShipGlowz and other assets without losing scope |
| Recenter on the project identity | `#pitch #partner #clarity` | the work to reload the project's core pitch when the agent starts losing the plot |
| Recenter on portfolio opportunity | `#portfolio #growth #partner` | the work to scan for useful cross-project leverage and transfer patterns |
| Improve retention logic | `#retention #end-user #funnel` | the work to focus on repeat usage, activation continuity, and product loops |
| Repair doc drift at the right layer | `#canon #drift #single-source` | the agent to fix the source of truth first instead of patching duplicate surfaces |
| Recenter on governance compliance | `#rules #canon #owner` | the agent to reload the full governed-project rule set before deciding what is missing, duplicated, or non-compliant |
| Recenter on documentation compliance | `#docs #canon #internal-docs` | the agent to enforce documentation architecture, metadata, and canonical placement before patching local surfaces |
| Choose the right doc surface | `#owner #entrypoint #public-docs` | the question is mostly where a message or contract should live publicly |
| Recenter on internal operator truth | `#owner #entrypoint #internal-docs` | the issue belongs in internal docs, technical contracts, or execution-facing guidance |
| Tighten execution without wandering | `#quality #scope #no-drift` | the agent to choose a bounded, high-quality route and stop exploring |
| Prepare a ship-ready answer | `#ship #proof #quality` | the work to end with checks, evidence, and release discipline instead of advice only |
| Work on ShipGlowz itself | `#shipflow #proof #contract` | the target is the internal ShipGlowz system and the output should strengthen doctrine or proofability |
| Harden ShipGlowz behavior | `#shipflow-core #contract #no-drift` | the goal is execution fidelity, routing discipline, or internal hardening |

## Quick Examples

```text
#partner #growth
This flow is technically fine but not helping conversion enough.
```

```text
#offer #cta #clarity
The page explains a lot but still does not make the offer obvious.
```

```text
#end-user #quality
This solves the bug but still feels too hard for a normal user.
```

```text
#faq #trust #seo-intent
Turn this objection-heavy draft into something users can find and believe.
```

```text
#canon #drift #public-docs
Recenter on the source of truth and fix the docs that are now out of sync.
```

```text
#shipflow #proof
Work on the ShipGlowz system itself and make the contract more testable.
```

```text
#founder-mode #growth #no-drift
Do the most useful thing for adoption and stop wandering.
```

## Default Rule

If you use one or more focus tags, ShipGlowz should reload those canonical documents first and keep them as high-priority context for the current turn.

If you combine several tags, ShipGlowz should merge them in the narrowest coherent way instead of treating them as conflicting by default.
