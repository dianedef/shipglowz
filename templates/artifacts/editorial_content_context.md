# [Editorial Content Context Title]

## Purpose

Explain what public-content, claim, page-intent, or runtime content governance this artifact owns.

## Owned Surfaces

| Surface | Path | Role | Source of truth | Update trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[surface]` | `[path]` | `[public job]` | `[contract/spec/evidence]` | `[trigger]` |

## Claim Boundaries

State which public claims this artifact governs and where claim evidence must be checked before publication.

## Page Intent

State which page, route, README section, FAQ/support surface, or content collection this artifact maps.

## Runtime Content Policy

If this artifact references runtime content such as Astro, MDX, CMS entries, or app-rendered Markdown, preserve the framework schema. Do not force ShipFlow metadata into runtime content unless the local schema explicitly accepts it.

## Editorial Update Plan

```markdown
## Editorial Update Plan

- Required action: `[none|review|update|create|remove|surface missing|pending final copy]`
- Reason: `[why]`
- Owner role: `[Editorial Reader|executor|integrator|human decision]`
- Parallel-safe: `[yes|no]`
- Validation: `[check]`
- Closure status: `[complete|no editorial impact|pending final copy|blocked]`
```

## Maintenance Rule

Update this artifact when its owned public surfaces, claim boundaries, page intent, source contracts, or runtime content schema assumptions change.
