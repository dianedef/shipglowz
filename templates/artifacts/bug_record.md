  - [BUG-ID with relation, for example duplicate-of, blocks, related]
- Related artifacts:
  - [spec, verification report, or decision record path]

## Lifecycle Notes

Canonical bug lifecycle statuses:

- `open`
- `needs-info`
- `needs-repro`
- `in-diagnosis`
- `fix-attempted`
- `fixed-pending-verify`
- `closed`
- `closed-without-retest`
- `duplicate`
- `wontfix`

Status transitions must stay explicit in this dossier and in `BUGS.md`.

## Redaction Status

- Current redaction status: `[not-reviewed|redacted|not-required|rejected]`
- Redaction notes:
  - [what was redacted, what was omitted, and why]

## Closure Criteria

- `closed` requires at least one passing retest entry linked to the fix attempt.
- `closed-without-retest` requires an explicit reason plus residual risk.
- `duplicate` requires a linked canonical bug ID.
- `wontfix` requires a visible scope or product decision.

## Next Step

[Concrete command and owner, for example `/sg-test --retest BUG-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN`]
