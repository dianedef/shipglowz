# [Provider] Project Usage

## Purpose

Document how this project, monorepo, app, or package actually uses `[provider]`. This file must live under the canonical governance root at `shipglowz_data/technical/platforms/[provider].md`; in monorepos, that means the monorepo root, not each app/package subdirectory.

This is the local usage contract, not a copy of vendor docs.

Use the global provider note for general source links and ShipFlow rules:

- `shipglowz_data/technical/external-platforms/[provider].md`

## Usage Summary

- Provider role:
- Project/provider identifier:
- Applies to paths:
- Environments used:
- Validation surface:
- Owner:
- Last verified:

## Local Configuration

| Item | Value or rule | Secret? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Production branch |  | no |  |
| Preview branches/custom envs |  | no |  |
| Domains/callback origins |  | no | Use public origins only when safe |
| Build command |  | no |  |
| Output/runtime expectation |  | no |  |
| Required env var keys |  | keys only | Never record values |

## Runtime And Integration Notes

- Auth/callback behavior:
- API/webhook behavior:
- Storage/cache/CDN behavior:
- Logs/observability route:
- MCP/CLI/dashboard evidence route:

## Invariants

- [Rule that must remain true for this project.]

## Failure Modes

- [Provider-specific failure] -> [Expected diagnosis or owner skill route.]

## Security Notes

- Do not store secrets, tokens, raw provider logs, cookies, private URLs, or customer data here.
- Record environment variable keys only, never values.
- Summarize sensitive provider evidence with redaction.

## Validation

```bash
[project-specific provider verification command or "manual provider proof required"]
```

## Reader Checklist

- Provider-related code/config changed -> review this usage note.
- Provider docs or releases changed -> compare against the global provider note and this usage note.
- Project validation surface changes -> update this note before treating checks as authoritative.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this doc when provider configuration, environments, domains, callbacks, validation surface, build/runtime behavior, evidence route, or security assumptions change.
