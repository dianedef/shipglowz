slug: "sg-audit-design-tokens"
tagline: "Audit whether your design tokens behave like a system or just a loose pile of values."
summary: "A specialist audit for theme, typography, spacing, and motion tokens across a frontend design system."
category: "Audit & Improve"
audience:
  - "Founders building a reusable design language"
  - "Teams whose UI feels inconsistent at the token layer"
problem: "Products drift visually when tokens are partial, duplicated, or weakly structured, even if the interface still looks acceptable on the surface."
outcome: "You get a token-level review that shows whether the visual system is coherent enough to scale."
founder_angle: "This skill is for the moment when the problem is deeper than a single screen. It helps you see whether the primitives themselves are stable."
when_to_use:
  - "When colors, spacing, or typography feel inconsistent across the product"
  - "When a design audit points to weak token architecture"
  - "When a team wants to make its design system more reusable"
what_you_give:
  - "A token source, theme layer, or frontend project"
  - "The current design-system implementation"
what_you_get:
  - "A token-architecture review"
  - "Findings across color, type, spacing, and motion systems"
  - "A stronger basis for system cleanup, token migration, or preview tooling"
example_prompts:
  - "/sg-audit-design-tokens"
  - "/sg-audit-design-tokens src/styles"
  - "/sg-audit-design-tokens apps/web/theme"
limits:
  - "It audits token architecture; it does not generate a finished design system by itself"
  - "Fixing token drift usually requires coordinated CSS and component changes"
