title: "sg-spec"
slug: "sg-spec"
tagline: "Turn a fuzzy request into an implementation-ready contract before code starts mutating the repo."
summary: "The spec-writing skill for shaping non-trivial work into a clear user story, behavior contract, executable task list, and chantier history."
category: "Plan & Decide"
audience:
  - "Founders doing non-trivial build work with agents"
  - "Teams that want a stronger bridge from intent to implementation"
problem: "Ambiguous tasks create drift fast: the agent guesses scope, the code moves ahead of the product intent, and validation becomes harder afterward."
outcome: "You get a sharper implementation contract and chantier registry that a fresh agent can execute without relying on chat memory."
founder_angle: "This skill is central when the task matters enough that guessing would be expensive. It converts product intent into something operational. It also keeps declared product surfaces, public claims, and proof obligations explicit when those decisions need to be visible to future agents."
when_to_use:
  - "When the work touches multiple files or domains"
  - "When the behavior contract is still fuzzy"
  - "When you want the implementation to start from an explicit user story"
  - "When the work needs a product-coherence decision before content or code can move safely"
what_you_give:
  - "A feature request, bug scope, or build goal"
  - "The current repo and product context"
what_you_get:
  - "A structured implementation spec"
  - "A clearer view of scope, behavior, and validation"
  - "Initial Skill Run History and Current Chantier Flow"
  - "A safer handoff into readiness and build work"
  - "Explicit notes about product inventory, surface placement, and claim evidence when those are part of the contract"
example_prompts:
  - "/sg-spec public skills hub and per-skill pages"
  - "/sg-spec auth onboarding rewrite"
  - "/sg-spec export flow for project data"
limits:
  - "It creates the contract, not the implementation"
  - "Weak or unresolved product decisions must still be clarified during spec work"
