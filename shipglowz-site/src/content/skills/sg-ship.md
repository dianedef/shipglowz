title: "sg-ship"
slug: "sg-ship"
tagline: "Commit and push quickly when the work is actually ready, instead of stretching closure into another vague step."
summary: "A shipping skill for moving finished work through the final commit-and-push path and recording the shipping result when a chantier spec is in scope."
category: "Operate & Ship"
audience:
  - "Founders who prefer fast closure once work is ready"
  - "Operators who want a cleaner final step after validation"
problem: "Work can get stuck in a half-finished state where the changes are ready locally but never move cleanly through the final shipping step."
outcome: "You get a more decisive transition from verified local work to committed and pushed changes, with visible handling of linked bug risk."
founder_angle: "This skill matters because shipping should be a crisp move, not an endless wobble after the real work is already done, and it should not blur residual bug risk into a false sense of closure."
when_to_use:
  - "When the implementation is ready to commit and push"
  - "When you want the fast shipping path instead of a long close-out ritual"
  - "After technical and behavioral validation is already done"
what_you_give:
  - "A repo with ready-to-ship changes"
  - "The current branch and git state"
what_you_get:
  - "A cleaner final shipping move"
  - "A shipped, blocked, or skipped-checks signal in the spec's chantier flow when applicable"
  - "A shipping report that keeps linked high or critical bug risk visible"
  - "Less hesitation between done locally and done in git"
  - "A tighter release habit for small workstreams"
example_prompts:
  - "/sg-ship"
  - "/sg-ship current branch"
  - "/sg-ship after verify"
  - "/sg-ship ship release notes all-dirty"
argument_modes:
  - argument: "no special argument"
    effect: "Runs quick ship mode: lightweight checks when practical, then commit and push."
    consequence: "Stages only changes that clearly belong to the current task or the selected shipping scope."
  - argument: "skip-check"
    effect: "Skips the pre-commit checks."
    consequence: "The report must say validation was skipped; this is a force-through path, not proof the work is safe."
  - argument: "end la tache / end / fin / close task"
    effect: "Switches from quick ship to full close mode."
    consequence: "Adds the formal close-out flow before shipping, including task/changelog bookkeeping when relevant."
  - argument: "all-dirty / ship-all / tout-dirty"
    effect: "Stages the entire dirty Git state in the selected repo after the secret check."
    consequence: "Includes modified, deleted, and untracked files even when they were not touched in the current conversation."
limits:
  - "It assumes the work is already ready; it is not a substitute for review or verification"
  - "If the branch is messy or the scope is unclear, earlier workflow steps still matter"
  - "Quick ship mode does not become full verification, and it must not hide linked high or critical bug risk"

## Ship Risk

When the scope includes linked bug records, the shipping report should name them and keep the risk visible. A quick ship can move code, but it does not convert unresolved bug risk into proof of verification.

If a high or critical bug is still open and related to the ship scope, the report should say so plainly rather than burying it behind commit-and-push success.
