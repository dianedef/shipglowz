title: "sg-review"
slug: "sg-review"
tagline: "Review recent work and the session state before you lose the thread of what changed."
summary: "A review skill for summarizing recent changes, identifying remaining gaps, and updating local workflow state cleanly."
category: "Plan & Decide"
audience:
  - "Founders wrapping a meaningful work block"
  - "Operators who want a more deliberate checkpoint after implementation"
problem: "Recent work often lands without a clean synthesis of what changed, what remains open, and what the next thread should inherit."
outcome: "You get a more explicit review state instead of leaving future-you to infer meaning from raw diffs and chat."
founder_angle: "This skill is useful when the work moved fast and you want a stronger checkpoint before switching contexts."
when_to_use:
  - "After a concentrated session of implementation or cleanup"
  - "When you want a better summary of recent progress"
  - "When the next thread should start from a cleaner checkpoint"
what_you_give:
  - "The current repo and conversation state"
  - "Any recent work window you want reviewed"
what_you_get:
  - "A clearer summary of what changed"
  - "A better view of what remains open"
  - "Evidence-based local tracker updates when the review justifies them"
  - "A stronger handoff into the next session"
example_prompts:
  - "/sg-review"
  - "/sg-review current session"
  - "/sg-review recent site and docs changes"
limits:
  - "It summarizes and evaluates recent work; it does not replace full verification on risky flows"
  - "If the work itself is unclear, follow-up docs or specs may still be needed"
