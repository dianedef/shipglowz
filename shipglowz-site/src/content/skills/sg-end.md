title: "sg-end"
slug: "sg-end"
tagline: "Close a task cleanly so the work is summarized, tracked, and ready for the next thread."
summary: "A task-closing skill for wrapping up implementation, documenting completion, and recording closure in the chantier flow when applicable."
category: "Operate & Ship"
audience:
  - "Founders who want disciplined task closure"
  - "Teams that care about clean handoffs between sessions"
problem: "Work often ends in an ambiguous state where the code changed, but the task record, changelog, or summary did not."
outcome: "You get a cleaner end-of-task handoff with explicit closure signals instead of loose thread residue."
founder_angle: "This skill helps you avoid the classic 'done in code, unclear everywhere else' problem that slows future sessions."
when_to_use:
  - "When a task is finished locally and needs a clean close-out"
  - "When task records or summaries should be updated after implementation"
  - "When you want to leave the repo in a more legible state for the next thread"
what_you_give:
  - "A completed task or workstream"
  - "The current repo and project tracking context"
what_you_get:
  - "A cleaner task wrap-up"
  - "Updated completion context for later sessions"
  - "A closed chantier signal when a unique spec-first workstream is in scope"
  - "Less ambiguity about what was actually finished"
example_prompts:
  - "/sg-end"
  - "/sg-end after onboarding fix"
  - "/sg-end close current task"
limits:
  - "It closes work; it does not replace technical verification or shipping steps"
  - "If the implementation is still ambiguous, another workflow step should happen first"
