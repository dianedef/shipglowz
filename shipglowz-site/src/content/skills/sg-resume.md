title: "sg-resume"
slug: "sg-resume"
tagline: "Summarize the current thread before context decay forces you to reread everything."
summary: "A fast recap skill for compressing the current conversation into the key points, task states, visible commits, and next-step reality."
category: "Meta & Setup"
audience:
  - "Founders working in long or fragmented threads"
  - "Operators deciding whether a conversation is safe to close"
problem: "Long sessions become expensive to resume because the important state is buried inside too much raw chat."
outcome: "You get a compact recap that restores the shape of the work faster than rereading the full thread, including whether commits were visibly made in the conversation."
founder_angle: "This skill matters because context debt grows invisibly. A short truthful recap is often enough to preserve momentum across sessions."
when_to_use:
  - "When a thread is getting long or hard to follow"
  - "Before closing a session"
  - "When you need a quick state transfer into the next conversation"
what_you_give:
  - "The current thread context"
  - "Optionally a specific need for a close-out summary"
what_you_get:
  - "A compact summary of the active thread"
  - "Current task status visibility"
  - "A short commits section with either no commits or short hashes plus 2-3 descriptive words"
  - "A better decision about whether the session can end safely"
example_prompts:
  - "/sg-resume"
  - "/sg-resume before I close this thread"
  - "/sg-resume what is still open"
limits:
  - "It compresses context; it does not replace a full spec or durable doc when one is needed"
  - "It reports commit information only when visible in the conversation; it does not inspect Git history"
  - "Bad thread discipline upstream still reduces what a summary can recover"
