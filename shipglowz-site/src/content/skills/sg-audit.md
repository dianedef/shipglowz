slug: "sg-audit"
tagline: "Run a broad project audit when you need a high-level map of what is weak before you decide what to fix."
summary: "The top-level audit skill scans across multiple quality domains so you can see where the real risk or drift sits."
category: "Audit & Improve"
audience:
  - "Solo founders preparing a cleanup or quality pass"
  - "Teams that need a quick cross-functional review before shipping"
problem: "Founders often know a project feels uneven but do not know whether the biggest issue is code quality, design drift, weak copy, SEO, or process debt."
outcome: "You get a broad review that surfaces the highest-signal weaknesses before you spend time patching the wrong layer."
founder_angle: "This skill is useful when the problem is still diagnostic. Instead of choosing a fix path too early, you get a map of where the project is actually soft."
when_to_use:
  - "When you want a broad health check before prioritizing work"
  - "When the project feels inconsistent but the root problem is unclear"
  - "When you want a pre-ship or pre-redesign review"
what_you_give:
  - "A project or page to review"
  - "The current repository context"
what_you_get:
  - "A cross-domain audit summary"
  - "Higher-signal findings to investigate first"
  - "A clearer path toward targeted specialist audits"
example_prompts:
  - "/sg-audit"
  - "/sg-audit src/pages/home.astro"
  - "/sg-audit before launch"
limits:
  - "It is a discovery tool first, not a direct implementation step"
  - "Broad coverage is useful for prioritization, but specialist follow-up is often needed"
