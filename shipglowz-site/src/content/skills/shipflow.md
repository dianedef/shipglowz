slug: "shipflow"
tagline: "Start with one plain instruction and let ShipGlowz choose the right workflow."
summary: "The primary non-technical router skill for answering simple questions directly or handing real work to the right ShipGlowz master or specialist skill."
category: "Plan & Decide"
audience:
  - "Founders who do not want to memorize every sf-* command"
  - "Operators who know the outcome but not the right workflow route"
  - "Teams that want routing decisions kept visible in the main thread"
problem: "A user can lose momentum before work starts by having to choose between build, bug, maintenance, content, design, deploy, skill, and audit workflows."
outcome: "You get one first command that either answers directly, routes the current thread to the right ShipGlowz skill, or asks one numbered clarification question when no context-safe route exists."
founder_angle: "The router keeps the first move simple. You describe the business or product need, and ShipGlowz chooses whether the work is conversation, build, maintenance, bug, release, content, design, skill maintenance, or audit. The router also steers requests into product-aware content and docs paths when declared products or public claims are part of the work."
when_to_use:
  - "When you want the recommended first command and do not know which skill to launch"
  - "When the request might be a feature, bug, maintenance run, content task, design task, deploy proof, skill change, audit, or simple question"
  - "When you want the selected master skill to own its normal lifecycle after routing"
  - "When you want the first answer to preserve product coherence instead of treating claims or surfaces as incidental"
what_you_give:
  - "A plain-language instruction"
  - "Any known target file, feature, bug symptom, deployment, content surface, or audit concern"
what_you_get:
  - "A direct conversational answer for pure questions"
  - "A direct main-thread handoff to the selected skill for real work"
  - "One numbered question when the route is ambiguous"
  - "No hidden master-skill-in-subagent nesting"
  - "A route that keeps product governance, claims, and surface coherence visible when the task touches shipped or market-facing material"
example_prompts:
  - "shipflow explain which docs govern skill runtime"
  - "shipflow fix the checkout bug"
  - "shipflow prepare this change for deploy proof"
argument_modes:
  - argument: "<instruction>"
    effect: "Classifies the request and either answers directly or hands the main thread to the selected ShipGlowz skill."
    consequence: "Routes feature/code/docs to sg-build, mixed build-plus-customer requests to sg-build first with a post-build sg-customer gate, maintenance to sg-maintain, bugs to sg-bug, release/deploy/prod proof to sg-deploy, content to sg-content, design to sg-design, customer-experience work to sg-customer, internal skill maintenance to the internal 900 core workflow, and obvious specialist audits to sg-audit-*."
limits:
  - "It does not replace the selected skill's lifecycle gates"
  - "It uses context-safe defaults only when they are clear, low-risk, reversible, and verifiable"
  - "It asks a numbered question with the reason and recommended route instead of guessing when routing is ambiguous"
  - "It does not run master skills inside hidden subagents"

## The First Command

Use `shipflow <instruction>` when you want ShipGlowz to choose the route. It is
for the first moment of a request, before you know whether the work is a build,
bug loop, maintenance run, release proof, content task, design task, skill change, audit, or
just a question.

## Named Profiles And Focus Tags

If you want the same router with a different decision posture, use a named
profile with `%<Profile>`.

- `%Victoire` biases toward growth, leverage, and explicit prioritization.
- `%Prudence` biases toward risk surfacing and coherence control.
- `%Ariane` biases toward clean sequencing, dependency mapping, and a bounded first slice.
- `%Adhesion` biases toward end-user trust, clarity, and friction review.
- `%SEO-specialist` biases toward search intent, discoverability, and page coherence.

Keep focus tags separate. `#growth`, `#clarity`, or `#Adhesion` are recentering
signals, not named profile activation.

Example:

```text
shipflow %Ariane update the internal docs and external surfaces #Adhesion
```

That means: keep Ariane's planning posture active, keep adhesion concerns
visible, and let ShipGlowz still route the work to the right owner skill.

## Install Path

Install ShipGlowz in Codex by adding the repository marketplace source:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add dianedef/ShipGlowz --ref main --sparse .agents/plugins --sparse plugins/shipflow
```

Then restart Codex, open the plugin directory, install `shipglowz` from the
`ShipGlowz` marketplace, and begin with:

```text
$shipglowz help me choose the right workflow
```

The router keeps the handoff visible. If it selects a master skill, that skill
takes over the main thread and owns its own delegated sequential execution.
If no route is safely implied by the instruction and project context, the router
asks one numbered decision question with the reason and recommended route.
