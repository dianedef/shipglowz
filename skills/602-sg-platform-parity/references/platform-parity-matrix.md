# Platform Parity Matrix

Use this reference when `602-sg-platform-parity` needs durable evidence or handoff detail.

## Matrix Columns

| Capability | User expectation | Platform | Verdict | Evidence | Gap | Owner route | QA route | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Verdicts:

- `same`
- `adapted-better`
- `adapted-required`
- `degraded-accepted`
- `not-supported`
- `unknown`

Gap values:

- `none`
- `implementation`
- `native-host`
- `shared-ui`
- `permission`
- `test-proof`
- `manual-qa`
- `docs-claim`
- `release-risk`

Owner routes:

- `100-sg-spec`: new parity chantier needed
- `001-sg-build`: implementation can start from a clear contract
- `107-sg-test`: native or device QA is the primary missing proof
- `103-sg-verify`: readiness and coherence need verification
- `300-sg-docs`: claim or operator guidance correction
- `005-sg-ship`: only after verification with bounded ship scope

## Decision Log

Record adaptations explicitly:

| Date | Capability | Platform | Decision | Why better or required | Accepted by | Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

An adaptation is acceptable when it is either materially better for that platform or required by OS, browser, store, hardware, permission, or distribution constraints. Equivalent alternatives should keep the same user experience.

## Report Shape

In `report=user`, summarize:

1. parity verdict
2. top gaps by platform
3. implementation or QA route
4. claim drift, if any

In `report=agent`, include the full matrix, evidence pointers, and decision log.
