# Preview Proof Routing

Apply this doctrine when project development mode is `vercel-preview-push` or when a `hybrid` project needs hosted proof.

## Route

When the changed behavior needs preview, browser, auth, webhook, deployed-runtime, or manual user-flow evidence, the required route is:

`005-sg-ship` -> `405-sg-prod` -> downstream proof owner

Downstream proof owner examples:

- `108-sg-browser` for non-auth browser-visible proof
- `109-sg-auth-debug` for auth/session/callback/protected-route proof
- `107-sg-test --preview` for manual or multi-step preview QA

## Rules

- Do not claim browser, preview, auth, integration, or manual user-flow validation from local evidence alone when project mode requires deployed proof.
- Do not ask the operator to run preview/manual/browser proof before `005-sg-ship` has pushed and `405-sg-prod` has confirmed the matching deployment target.
- After successful ship in preview-required mode, `405-sg-prod` is the immediate next step.
- If preview validation is still missing, keep closure, verification, and changelog framing below `done`/`verified`/`released` strength as the local skill contract requires.

## Local Anchor Rule

Keep a compact local anchor in skills where preview-proof routing is a first-screen execution risk, but keep the detailed doctrine here rather than repeating the route text verbatim across skills.
