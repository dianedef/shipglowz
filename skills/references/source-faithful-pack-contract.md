# Source-Faithful Pack Contract

## Purpose

Define the canonical structure and minimum rules for a reusable source-faithful pack.

This contract is shared doctrine. Owner skills may narrow it locally, but they should not silently weaken source-faithfulness, evidence separation, or handoff clarity.

## Mandatory Output Backbone

Use this section order unless a stricter owner skill says otherwise:

1. `Best Next Actions`
2. `Source-Faithful Pack`
3. `Existing Content Opportunities`
4. `Owner Skill Handoffs`
5. `Evidence Ledger`

Optional appendices may follow when justified:

- `Optional Surface Draft Seeds`
- `Titles For This Conversation`
- `Article Name Ideas`
- `Supporting Source Notes`

## Default Template

## Operating Rules

- `Best Next Actions` comes first and must stay actionable without reading the full pack.
- `Source-Faithful Pack` is mandatory. It must remain useful even when the downstream surface is unresolved.
- Keep source facts, reusable wording, justified surfaces, and unsafe claims clearly separated.
- `Evidence Ledger` is mandatory whenever the output includes public-facing claims or owner handoffs.
- `Existing Content Opportunities` should identify where the source improves existing surfaces, not only propose new ones.
- `Supporting Source Notes` is an appendix, not the default top section.

## Compression Rules

- If the work is internal only, keep `Marketing Claims` to one short line or `None justified`.
- If the work is tiny, collapse `Internal Change Narrative` into 2-3 bullets.
- If the user asked for one surface only, keep the other sections brief but keep the evidence ledger.
- If the source is third-party text, favor `Source Analysis`, `Marketing Claims`, and `Content Angles` over build-specific notes.
- If the user asked for ideas or titles, expand `Best Next Actions` first, then add the title appendix only if useful.
- If the user asked where to improve existing content, expand `Existing Content Opportunities` and compress article-title exploration.

## Storage Relationship

When the pack is durable and safe to persist in the governed project repo, follow `skills/references/repurpose-pack-storage.md` for path, naming, metadata, and ownership.
