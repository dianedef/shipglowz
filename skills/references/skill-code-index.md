# Skill Code Index

## Purpose

This is the canonical ShipGlowz runtime skill-name map.

The code is now part of the runtime-visible skill identity. For example:

```text
old name: 001-sg-build
runtime name: 001-sg-build
operator invocation: $001-sg-build
```

## Resolution Rules

- Runtime skill names use `NNN-<old-name>`.
- The three-digit code is stable after ship.
- The suffix preserves the old skill name exactly.
- Old unprefixed names may appear only as legacy aliases, historical evidence, or natural-language route hints.
- Do not create wrapper skills for old names unless a future ready spec explicitly accepts duplicate picker entries.

## Family Bands

| Band | Family | Memory rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `000-099` | Master and high-frequency entrypoints | Most frequent and highest-level commands get the easiest codes; an entrypoint in this band is not necessarily a lifecycle master. |
| `100-199` | Lifecycle and proof | Spec, readiness, execution, verification, checks, fixes, browser/auth/test proof. |
| `200-299` | Content, research, and copy | Writing, enrichment, repurposing, market/research/watch, and copy audits. |
| `300-399` | Docs, context, and support | Docs, help, context, changelog, init, scaffold, status, tasks. |
| `400-499` | Audit, quality, and ops risk | Broad audit, production proof, SEO, and i18n; technical depth moved to high-frequency entrypoint 010. |
| `500-599` | Unassigned legacy band | Former design-specialist band; design now routes through `006-sg-design` modes. Reuse requires a ready taxonomy decision. |
| `600-699` | Data and activation | Local-cloud sync, entitlements, parity, and future account/data surfaces. |
| `700-799` | Pilotage and session helpers | Explore, backlog, priorities, review, model choice, resume helpers. |
| `800-899` | Conversation and transcript helpers | Conversation capture and transcript tooling. |
| `900-999` | Reserved rare meta space | Reserved for future rare or migration-only skills. |

Frequency wins over family when a skill belongs to both. For example `007-sg-content` stays in the master band.

## Maintenance

Run this after adding, removing, or renaming a skill:

```bash
python3 tools/skill_code_index_lint.py
python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown
tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh --check --all
```

The linter must fail when:

- a code is duplicated
- a runtime skill appears twice
- a listed runtime skill directory is missing
- a `skills/*/SKILL.md` directory has no active code row
- the runtime skill does not equal `<code>-<old-name>`
