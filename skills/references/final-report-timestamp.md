# Final Report Opening Headers

Every ShipGlowz final report places a concise, visible verdict in Europe/Paris local time immediately after the chantier header. The verdict remains an opening heading, not a trailing footer.

## Required Opening

Use this two-line opening for every final report:

```text
🧱 CHANTIER (<local|spec>) : <name>
🎯 VERDICT (HH:mm) : <verdict or status>
```

Use the literal `VERDICT` label prefixed by `🎯` for user-facing reports, including reports that would otherwise use a named verdict label. Named internal status fields may remain in agent-mode artifacts.

For a genuinely blocked verdict, replace the first marker only:

```text
🚧 CHANTIER (<local|spec>) : <name>
🎯 VERDICT (HH:mm) : bloqué
```

## Rules

- Use `Europe/Paris` local time, not UTC, for the visible report timestamp.
- The displayed time is when the verdict or final status is pronounced, not when the task started.
- Display only `HH:mm`; do not include the calendar date in the verdict header.
- Keep UTC timestamps for internal ledgers, specs, run histories, and machine-readable artifacts that already require UTC.
- Put exactly one chantier header before the verdict; follow `reporting-contract.md` for local/spec selection and naming.
- Keep `🧱` for normal, successful, partial, or in-progress runs; use `🚧` only when the verdict is blocked.
- Put the substantive response immediately below the verdict: result, proof, limits, and any decision question.
- When route context helps the operator understand the next action, add `🧭 Suite : <outcome or decision> — <short reason>` directly below the verdict. Never name an internal owner, skill, command, lifecycle stage, or delegated agent there.
- Do not append a second verdict, timestamp, reminder, or commentary after the response. When a numbered decision is required, the final visible content must be the options followed by `Réponds avec le numéro, ou précise une autre option.`
- If a skill has no natural verdict, use a concise status such as `rapport terminé` or `non applicable`.
