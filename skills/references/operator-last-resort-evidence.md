# Operator-Last-Resort Evidence

Apply this doctrine before asking the operator for logs, screenshots, callback traces, reproduction details, validation status, or similar evidence.

## Rule

Exhaust safe local evidence first.

That includes, when relevant:

- safe project files and current diffs
- existing bug/spec/task memory
- local checks and bounded runtime logs
- browser-visible evidence
- runtime diagnostics surfaces and copy-log/copy-diagnostics actions
- auth-safe Playwright/browser proof

Ask the operator only for:

- real decisions
- secrets or privileged access
- unavailable environments
- manual-only or device-only proof
- unsafe or external side effects

## Runtime Diagnostics

When a runtime app exposes a diagnostics, support, debug, settings, or callback-error surface, use `runtime-diagnostics-surface.md` before asking the operator for logs.

When copied diagnostics are available, confirm the build identity header:

```text
commit/build: <sha or build id>
build_at_paris: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm Europe/Paris
build_at_utc: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm UTC
```

If the diagnostics surface is missing, unsafe, blocked by permissions, or does not expose usable text, report that limitation explicitly instead of silently bouncing the evidence request to the operator.

## Local Anchor Rule

Keep a compact local anchor in skills where operator-last-resort behavior is a first-screen execution risk, but keep the detailed doctrine here instead of repeating it verbatim across skills.
