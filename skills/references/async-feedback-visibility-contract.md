# Shared Async Feedback Visibility Contract

Any user-visible operation that may take longer than an immediate response must make its state legible. This is a cross-project behavior contract, not a mandate for one visual component or animation library.

## Minimum contract

- Start with an animation or measurable progress indicator immediately.
- Name the current stage in plain language: what is being checked, loaded, saved, or processed.
- Prevent duplicate actions while work is active, or safely coalesce them.
- End in success, error, timeout, retry, or cancellation; never leave an indefinite busy state.
- Preserve accessible status semantics with reduced motion and assistive technology.
- Keep status text and diagnostics free of tokens, cookies, credentials, and private payloads.

## Ownership

Project design systems choose tokens, motion carrier, and component primitives. Customer flows choose journey copy and recovery language. Feature/auth owners define real stages and terminal outcomes. This contract owns the minimum observable behavior and proof obligation.

## Adoption proof

For each adopted flow, record the trigger, busy indicator, stage copy, terminal states, duplicate-action behavior, timeout/retry path, reduced-motion behavior, and redacted diagnostics. Use the checklist at `shipglowz_data/technical/async-feedback-visibility-adoption-checklist.md`.
