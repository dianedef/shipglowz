# Actionable Failure Contract

## Purpose

When a failure is detected, the response must separate:

- what is observed,
- what the evidence says,
- what is the proposed owner action.

The contract exists to avoid generic reports that cannot be converted into durable work.

## Core Rule

A failure is actionable when a clear, specific, low-friction owner route exists.

## Actionability Test

Use this checklist before producing a final failure report:

- Evidence is tied to a file, excerpt, or transcript area.
- Impact is explicit (`user`, `workflow`, `release`, `quality`, `security`).
- Recommended owner skill is in one of the canonical domain skills.
- The route is testable and does not require speculative broad edits.

## Valid Owner Routing

- `009-sg-skill-build`: contract or behavior definition updates.
- `300-sg-docs`: doc/contract correction when public behavior or workflow text is misaligned.
- `103-sg-verify`: missing evidence, proof gap, or incorrect assumptions.
- `100-sg-spec`: when implementation surface is non-trivial and requires a new durable spec.

## Non-Actionable Report Conditions

Mark a finding non-actionable when all are true:

- evidence is weak or absent,
- owner route is ambiguous,
- or impact is speculative user preference.

If non-actionable:

- report `already covered` if a stable contract already addresses it,
- record a confidence limit,
- avoid auto-routing to a chantier.
