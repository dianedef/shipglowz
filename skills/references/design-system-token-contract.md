# Design-System Token Contract

## Purpose

Make design-system centralization a blocking execution contract, not a preference.

Use this reference before UI, UX, mobile, component, layout, theme, typography, spacing, color, shadow/elevation, motion, safe-area, keyboard/IME, overlay, or responsive implementation, fix, audit, or verification work.

## Core Rule

Every visual decision must resolve through the project's declared design-system authority. The default declaration location is `shipglowz_data/technical/design-system-authority.md`; monorepos keep that declaration at the monorepo governance root, with scoped app entries only when needed.

Do not introduce or change raw one-off values in screens, components, route files, or local styles for:

- colors and opacity
- typography families, sizes, line heights, weights, and letter spacing
- spacing, gaps, dimensions, insets, safe-area offsets, and keyboard/IME offsets
- radii, borders, shadows, elevation, z-index layers, overlays, and scrims
- motion durations, easings, animation distances, and transition behavior
- breakpoints, density, touch target sizes, and responsive/adaptive layout constants

The allowed path is:

1. identify the canonical token/theme/component/layout source
2. add or update a named semantic token/constant there only when needed
3. consume that token through components, variants, utilities, or theme APIs
4. prove no unintended visual drift with token checks and visual evidence

## Canonical Sources

Treat the existing project declaration as authoritative. If it is missing, infer only enough to propose the declaration before editing UI:

- Web CSS: CSS custom properties in the central token/theme/global style layer.
- Tailwind: theme variables/config tokens; for Tailwind v4 prefer `@theme` CSS variables and `var(--...)` runtime access.
- React/Vue/Svelte/Astro components: consume tokens through CSS variables, variant systems, or typed theme objects, not local literals.
- Flutter: `ThemeData`, `ColorScheme`, `TextTheme`, `ThemeExtension`, shared `EdgeInsets`/radius/duration/curve/constants, and component themes.
- React Native/Expo: shared theme/tokens object plus typed component variants; avoid inline literal style drift.
- Native mobile: platform theme resources/tokens and adaptive layout APIs, not per-screen numeric drift.

If multiple sources exist, stop or ask one targeted question to choose the canonical source before writing design values. Record the decision in the project design-system authority artifact, not only in the final report.

## Mobile And App Design Rules

Mobile app UI must preserve professional app standards:

- adaptive layouts use platform or design-system breakpoints/window classes, not arbitrary viewport checks
- safe area, keyboard, navigation-bar, and IME behavior use platform measurement APIs or named shared constants
- touch targets meet WCAG 2.2 AA minimums and platform recommendations; primary mobile targets should generally be at least 44px/44dp unless the platform pattern justifies otherwise
- dense operational apps still use tokenized density scales instead of screen-local compression
- dark mode, high contrast, reduced motion, and dynamic type/text scaling must be preserved where the project supports them

## Literal Exception Policy

A raw visual literal is allowed only when all of these are true:

- it is required by a platform/API/protocol contract or by a project-standard primitive pattern
- it is named as a shared constant/token if it will be reused
- its scope is local and documented if it truly cannot become a shared token
- validation proves it does not create design-system drift

Unexplained literals are defects. Verification must fail or report partial when a UI change ships by adding hardcoded values outside the source of truth.

## Required Scans

For changed UI/design files, run:

```bash
python3 "${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-$HOME/shipglowz}/tools/design_system_drift_check.py" --changed --format markdown
```

For audits or migration planning, run a broader scan:

```bash
python3 "${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-$HOME/shipglowz}/tools/design_system_drift_check.py" --format markdown --warn-only
```

The scan is evidence, not the only truth. If it reports acceptable platform-bound literals, the report must name the exception reason and proof.

## Stop Conditions

Stop, reroute, or report `partial`/`not verified` when:

- no design-system source of truth can be identified for a visual change
- the project has UI but no `design_system_authority` declaration and the task would change visual implementation
- the change introduces raw visual values outside that source of truth
- token edits are made but consuming pages/components are not migrated or the gap is hidden
- a component exposes `className`, `style`, inline style maps, or variant props that allow callers to bypass tokens without guardrails
- visual proof or token drift proof is missing for a claimed UI/design completion
- accessibility, reduced motion, dynamic type, contrast, focus, or target-size safety would be weakened to satisfy token discipline
