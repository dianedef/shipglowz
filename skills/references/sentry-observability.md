# Sentry Observability

Use this reference when a project bug, deploy, manual test, browser check, auth diagnosis, verification, audit, or performance review depends on runtime behavior.

## Default Assumption

ShipGlowz runtime projects are expected to have Sentry instrumentation unless the project explicitly documents an exception.

Sentry is not expected by default on static marketing, documentation, blog, or content sites when they have no authentication, account state, protected routes, checkout/payment flow, server-handled forms, or other user-specific runtime workflow. Do not add Sentry to static sites only to satisfy the runtime observability posture; rely on build/deploy checks, host logs, browser checks, and SEO/content validation.

Sentry becomes expected as soon as a site introduces authentication or user-specific runtime behavior. Auth, account, payment, protected content, server-side form handling, webhooks, jobs, or tenant-specific flows should not use the static-site exception.

Skills never have direct Sentry dashboard access. Do not attempt to open or query the dashboard as part of the skill contract.

Use Sentry only through evidence that is visible in the app, logs, error boundaries, support screens, pasted by the operator, or otherwise already present in the working context. If no Sentry issue/event pointer is available, use local PM2 logs and redacted Doppler environment checks as supporting runtime evidence instead of pretending Sentry was checked.

## Runtime Diagnostic Surface

Runtime projects should expose a safe diagnostics surface for users/operators: error boundary, support screen, debug panel, or diagnostics modal with a `Copy diagnostics` / `Copy logs` action.

Copied diagnostics/logs must start with build identity:

```text
commit/build: <sha or build id> <commit subject when safe>
build_at_paris: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm Europe/Paris
build_at_utc: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm UTC
```

Minimum useful payload after that: environment, release/build id, app version, route/screen, event timestamp, Sentry event/support id when present, and a short redacted client/server log summary. Never include secrets, cookies, tokens, auth codes, raw headers, full payloads, private user text, or PII.

`305-sg-init` should record whether the project has Sentry and a diagnostics/log-copy surface. Runtime specs should either preserve/add that surface or document a static-site exception. Browser-capable skills (`108-sg-browser`, `109-sg-auth-debug`) should use the visible diagnostics/copy-log UI when it is present before asking the operator for logs.

When implementation or audit work needs a concrete reusable pattern, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/runtime-diagnostics-surface.md`. Prefer reusing the project's existing diagnostics component/helper before creating a new UI.

For Flutter apps, treat Sentry as useful only when both layers are true:

- The SDK is initialized early enough to capture Flutter/native runtime failures.
- The build, CI, or app diagnostics prove the expected DSN, environment, release, dist/build identifiers, and Paris/UTC build timestamps are present without exposing secret values.

## Monitors And Alerts

As of the 2026 Sentry Monitors/Alerts model, use precise terminology:

- **Monitors** detect conditions and create or update Sentry issues. This includes Metric Monitors, Cron Monitors, Uptime Monitors, and other monitor types that can watch errors, spans, logs, custom metrics, check-ins, endpoint availability, releases, or build signals.
- **Alerts** route notifications or actions when issues are created or updated. Alert routing may send to Slack, email, PagerDuty, tickets, webhooks, or other destinations.
- **Metric Alerts** have migrated to **Metric Monitors**. Existing alert rules remain useful as notification routing, but threshold/detection review now belongs to the monitor.
- One Alert can be connected to many Monitors. Do not assume routing is correct for a specific monitor until the connected monitor, filters, actions, and notification result are visible or supplied.
- Crons and Uptime now live in the Monitors surface. Scheduled job proof should consider Cron check-ins; endpoint availability proof should consider Uptime monitor criteria when operator evidence is available.

This split does not change the dashboard-access rule. Skills still use only visible, pasted, logged, or operator-supplied evidence.

## When To Load This

- The app throws, crashes, renders an error boundary, or returns a 5xx.
- A browser console or network check shows an unhandled exception.
- A deploy is green but runtime health, auth, protected flows, jobs, webhooks, or user actions fail.
- A manual test fails and the user sees a Sentry event ID, support ID, error boundary, or crash report.
- A bug file, fix attempt, release check, or verification needs runtime evidence.
- An audit reviews error handling, reliability, telemetry, or performance overhead.
- A task claims monitoring, alerting, uptime, cron/job health, or notification-routing coverage.

## Evidence To Prefer

- Sentry issue URL or issue ID when supplied by the operator or visible in app/log output.
- Event ID shown by the app, copied from an error boundary, support screen, or logs.
- Sentry Monitor ID/name/type, issue short ID, connected Alert/workflow ID, and notification action when supplied by the operator or visible in logs/context.
- Metric Monitor evidence: data source or signal type, query/filter, aggregate, environment, time window, threshold type, priority thresholds, and latest/open monitor-created issue.
- Cron Monitor evidence: monitor slug/name, environment, last check-in window, missed/failed/timeout state, failure tolerance, max runtime, and linked issue when triggered.
- Uptime Monitor evidence: target URL/method, interval, timeout, assertion criteria, last check result, and linked issue when triggered.
- Alert routing evidence: source scope, environment filters, trigger/filter rationale, throttle/frequency, actions, and test or recent notification result.
- Release, commit SHA, environment, transaction, trace, replay, or suspect commit when available.
- First seen / last seen timestamps and affected users count when relevant and safe.
- Stack frame file/function/module after redacting private data.
- A concise event summary, not a raw payload dump.
- Local PM2 process/log evidence because direct Sentry dashboard access is not available to skills.
- Doppler secret presence/config status when environment variables may explain the failure, without printing secret values.
- For Flutter/mobile apps: `pubspec.lock` SDK version, `SentryFlutter.init` options, Dart defines, app diagnostics screen output, and CI evidence that `SENTRY_DSN` was present and masked.
- For GitHub Actions on Blacksmith: run ID, job name, runner label, step failure, artifact existence, and searchable log filters such as `branch:main level:error,warn` when the operator can access Blacksmith logs.

## Local PM2 And Doppler Fallback

Use this when Sentry is expected but no Sentry issue/event pointer is available, or when the runtime is a ShipGlowz/PM2-managed server app.

Safe PM2 commands:

```bash
pm2 list
pm2 logs contentflow_lab --lines 80 --nostream
tail -f ~/.pm2/logs/contentflow-lab-out.log
tail -f ~/.pm2/logs/contentflow-lab-error.log
```

Adapt the PM2 app name and log file names to the project when they differ. Prefer bounded, non-streaming logs for reports; use `tail -f` only for active live diagnosis, then summarize the relevant lines.

Doppler rules:

- Check that required env keys are present, scoped to the expected project/config/environment, and loaded by the running process.
- Report key names, config scope, and presence/absence only.
- Never print Doppler secret values, raw `doppler secrets`, raw `env`, or command output that includes secret values.
- If a value shape matters, report a redacted shape such as `present`, `missing`, `empty`, `looks like URL`, or `wrong environment`, not the value.

## Flutter App Checklist

Use this checklist for Flutter apps before recommending more Sentry work:

- Confirm `sentry_flutter` is current enough for the target platform. VoiceFlowz is already on `9.20.0`; do not recommend a migration just because an older docs page shows a lower package detail.
- Confirm initialization happens before `runApp` and does not break local development when `SENTRY_DSN` is missing.
- Confirm `sendDefaultPii=false` for privacy-sensitive apps unless the user explicitly accepts the data tradeoff.
- Confirm screenshots, view hierarchy, session replay, and user feedback screenshots are disabled or deliberately configured when the app handles voice, keyboard, clipboard, auth, private text, or user-owned files.
- Confirm the app records release/environment/build identifiers from CI, for example commit SHA, branch/ref, run ID, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `release`, `dist`, and Paris/UTC build timestamps.
- Confirm local error handlers preserve visible failures and do not swallow exceptions just because Sentry is installed.
- Add route/navigation correlation when the app has meaningful screens. For `MaterialApp.router`/`GoRouter`, prefer a Sentry navigator observer or router-compatible integration if the local router supports it.
- Add a deliberate verification event only in a controlled debug/test build, then remove or guard it. Do not ship a permanent button or startup crash test.
- If release builds use `--obfuscate`, `--split-debug-info`, native symbols, or web source maps, require a symbol/source-map upload plan before relying on Sentry stack traces.

## Feature Defaults

Use conservative defaults for privacy-sensitive ShipGlowz apps:

| Feature | Default | Enable when |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Error monitoring | yes | DSN and environment are configured. |
| Breadcrumbs | yes, redacted | Messages are sanitized and do not include user text, transcripts, tokens, prompts, clipboard contents, or private URLs. |
| Navigation tracking | yes | Route names are stable and do not include private IDs or user text. |
| Tracing | cautious | There is a concrete performance question; start with low sampling outside debug. |
| Profiling | cautious | Native/mobile performance diagnosis needs it and overhead is acceptable. |
| Logs | cautious | `enableLogs` is paired with redaction/filtering and log volume control. |
| Metric Monitors | yes for critical runtime flows | Stable low-cardinality signals, thresholds, and ownership are defined. |
| Cron Monitors | yes for critical scheduled jobs | Missed, failed, or slow check-ins would affect users, data, billing, or operations. |
| Uptime Monitors | useful for critical URLs | Endpoint status/header/body criteria prove more than a single `curl`. |
| Alerts | yes for critical monitors | Routing owner, filters, frequency, and action destination are explicit. |
| Screenshots/view hierarchy | no | The UI is known not to contain sensitive content, or explicit redaction/masking exists. |
| Session replay | no | Product/privacy review approves it and masking is proven on target screens. |
| User feedback screenshots | no | The support flow has explicit consent and redaction. |

For VoiceFlowz-like apps, keep screenshots/view hierarchy/session replay off by default because keyboard, voice, clipboard, auth, and private text surfaces are high-risk.

## Static Sites

Sentry is not expected for static marketing, documentation, blog, or content sites whose runtime is limited to static pages and non-critical client-side enhancement.

This static-site rule is valid when all of these are true:

- No authentication or account state.
- No protected or personalized routes.
- No checkout, payment, webhook, queue, or background job surface.
- No server-handled form submission or user-specific data mutation.
- No critical client-side workflow where a user's action can fail independently of the build/deploy pipeline.

When this applies, document in the project guidance or README that Sentry is not expected for the static site, and state that Sentry should be revisited if authentication or user-specific runtime behavior is added.

When any of those conditions stops being true, treat Sentry as required and follow the relevant browser, server, or app checklist instead of continuing to rely on the static-site rule.

## Correlation Rules

- When a Sentry pointer is supplied or visible, match it to the same environment being tested: `local`, `preview`, `production`, or project-specific equivalent.
- When a Sentry pointer is supplied or visible, match it to the deployed release or commit SHA when `405-sg-prod`, `004-sg-deploy`, `005-sg-ship`, or `103-sg-verify` depends on hosted evidence.
- When a Monitor-created issue or Alert notification is supplied, match monitor ID/name/type, issue/event ID, connected Alert/workflow ID, environment, release/commit, and trigger window before using it as proof.
- For migrated Metric Alerts, request evidence of both sides when possible: the Metric Monitor detection threshold and the connected Alert routing/action. Do not treat a routed notification alone as proof that the monitor threshold is correct.
- For Cron and Uptime monitors, match check-in or uptime result windows to the deploy/test window before claiming current production health.
- Match PM2 logs and Doppler config to the same app name, cwd, branch, environment, and deployment surface being diagnosed.
- For mobile builds produced by GitHub Actions/Blacksmith, match the Sentry release/dist to the workflow `GITHUB_SHA`, `GITHUB_REF_NAME`, and `GITHUB_RUN_ID` when the app uses those values as Dart defines.
- For preview-push projects, do not use old production issues as proof about the current preview unless the release/environment link is explicit.
- For auth, payment, data, webhook, job, or tenant failures, prefer server-side Sentry events over browser-only symptoms when both exist.
- Do not report "no matching Sentry event" unless an operator-provided or visible Sentry pointer/window was actually checked from available context. Otherwise report `Sentry: no direct dashboard access; PM2/Doppler checked`.

## Privacy And Redaction

- Never paste raw Sentry event payloads, breadcrumbs, request bodies, headers, cookies, tokens, auth codes, session data, private emails, PII, or private URLs into reports or bug files.
- Summarize sensitive fields and use placeholders such as `[REDACTED_TOKEN]`, `[REDACTED_EMAIL]`, or `[REDACTED_PRIVATE_URL]`.
- Do not expose full user lists, IP addresses, or session replay content in user reports. Use counts or redacted summaries.
- If a screenshot, replay, or breadcrumb contains sensitive data, reference it by Sentry issue/event ID only and state that redaction was applied.
- Treat monitor queries, uptime headers/bodies, custom metric attributes, alert payloads, webhook destinations, and notification screenshots as potentially sensitive. Report only redacted IDs, names, channels, conditions, and short impact summaries.

## Skill Reporting Rules

- Include Sentry evidence under `Evidence`, `Logs`, `Observability`, or `Limits` depending on the skill report shape.
- When copied diagnostics/logs are used, report whether the first lines exposed commit/build and Paris/UTC build time.
- If Sentry was expected but no issue/event pointer was available, say `Sentry: no direct dashboard access; no event pointer supplied`.
- If monitoring or alerting proof matters and no monitor/alert evidence is supplied, say `Sentry Monitors/Alerts: no direct dashboard access; no operator evidence supplied`.
- If a supplied/visible pointer was checked and no match was possible, say `Sentry: pointer not correlated to [environment/release/window]`.
- If a supplied/visible pointer is relevant, say `Sentry: [issue/event id]`, environment, release/commit if known, and one-line impact.
- If Monitor evidence is relevant, say `Sentry: monitor issue correlated`, then include monitor type, redacted monitor identifier, issue/event pointer, environment, release/window if known, and one-line impact.
- If Alert routing evidence is relevant, say `Sentry: alert routing correlated`, then include redacted alert/workflow identifier, source monitor, channel/action, and notification result.
- If only one side is proven, say `Sentry: monitor proven but routing gap` or `Sentry: routing proven but monitor gap`.
- If PM2/Doppler evidence was used instead, say `Sentry: no direct dashboard access; PM2/Doppler checked` and name the bounded evidence.
- If Sentry is not expected because the target is a static site, say `Sentry: not expected for static site; no auth or user-specific runtime workflow`.
- For Flutter apps, report Sentry state from app-visible diagnostics or build config when available: configured/initialized, environment, release, dist, Paris/UTC build timestamps, and whether CI injected a masked `SENTRY_DSN`.
- For Blacksmith-hosted CI, include the GitHub Actions run ID and a precise log query hint when it helps the operator investigate, for example `branch:main level:error,warn workflow:"Flutter Android CI"`.
- Do not let Sentry replace the owner skill proof: browser evidence still belongs to `108-sg-browser` / `109-sg-auth-debug`, deploy truth to `405-sg-prod`, manual QA to `107-sg-test`, and closure to `103-sg-verify`.

## Performance Notes

- Sentry browser tracing, profiling, session replay, source maps, and breadcrumbs can affect bundle size, network usage, privacy posture, and INP/LCP if configured carelessly.
- Audit sampling rates, replay masks, source map upload exposure, and disabled debug logging when performance or privacy is in scope.
- Audit monitor signal names and attributes for stable, bounded cardinality. High-cardinality per-user or raw-object tags make Metric Monitors noisy and can increase telemetry cost.
- Audit Alert routing for ownership, environment scope, filters, frequency, and duplicate notification risk after Metric Alert migration.
- Sentry instrumentation should preserve user/operator visibility of failures; do not swallow exceptions only to report them.
- Do not enable `tracesSampleRate = 1.0`, `profilesSampleRate = 1.0`, broad logs, or session replay in production by copying quick-start docs. Treat those examples as setup/verification defaults, then lower or disable them for production.
- For mobile apps, measure APK/AAB size and startup/performance overhead after enabling native crash reporting, tracing, profiling, logs, or replay.
