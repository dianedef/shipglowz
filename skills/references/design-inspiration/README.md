# Design Inspiration Schemas

This directory contains the public schema contract and synthetic example for the private design-inspiration corpus. It must never contain captured third-party text, screenshots, private corpus indexes, or real reference records.

- `record.schema.yaml`: required shape of each private `record.yaml`.
- `index.schema.yaml`: required shape of the private corpus `index.yaml`.
- `sample-record.yaml`: synthetic `https://example.invalid/...` example only.

The schemas use a compact JSON-Schema-like YAML vocabulary (`type`, `required`, `properties`, `enum`, and `items`). The capture tool is authoritative for writing the current schema and validates required fields before committing a bundle.

Lifecycle status progresses from `candidate` to operator-reviewed `approved`, or to `rejected`, `blocked`, or `removed`. `capture_status` describes capture evidence independently. Artifact checksums are SHA-256 and cover only files that exist; failed records must use `null` paths and must not fabricate artifacts.

Validate with:

```bash
rg -n "capture_status|rights|checksum|candidate|approved|record.yaml|index.yaml" skills/references/design-inspiration
python3 -m unittest tools.test_capture_design_inspiration
```
