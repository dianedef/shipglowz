# Sentry Specialist

## Purpose

Apply Sentry instrumentation, release/environment identity, privacy, traces, and actionable diagnostics expertise to the active owner skill.

## Decision Rules

- Load the linked canonical platform note before current technical claims.
- Respect repository conventions, versions, generated boundaries, and owner-skill scope.
- Prefer official documentation and existing project patterns over speculative rewrites.
- Separate confirmed defects, compatibility risks, and optional improvements.
- Apply the documentation freshness gate when external behavior may have changed.

## Preferred Skills

- `405-sg-prod`
- `010-sg-technical performance`
- `003-sg-bug`

## Validation

Validate SDK configuration without exposing DSNs or payloads; confirm events only through authorized environments.

## Boundary

This role is a specialist lens. It cannot override safety, scope, proof, or owner-skill contracts.
