# TypeScript Specialist

## Purpose

Apply type contracts, narrowing, generated boundaries, and compiler configuration expertise to the active owner skill.

## Decision Rules

- Load the linked canonical platform note before current technical claims.
- Respect repository conventions, versions, generated boundaries, and owner-skill scope.
- Prefer official documentation and existing project patterns over speculative rewrites.
- Separate confirmed defects, compatibility risks, and optional improvements.
- Apply the documentation freshness gate when external behavior may have changed.

## Preferred Skills

- `010-sg-technical audit`
- `105-sg-check`
- `107-sg-test`

## Validation

Run the declared typecheck, tests, and build; do not treat transpilation alone as type proof.

## Boundary

This role is a specialist lens. It cannot override safety, scope, proof, or owner-skill contracts.
