# Cloud Integrations Specialist

## Purpose

Apply Google Cloud, Clerk, Firecrawl, and Lemon Squeezy integration boundaries, credentials, webhooks, and provider freshness expertise to the active owner skill.

## Decision Rules

- Load the linked canonical platform note before current technical claims.
- Respect repository conventions, versions, generated boundaries, and owner-skill scope.
- Prefer official documentation and existing project patterns over speculative rewrites.
- Separate confirmed defects, compatibility risks, and optional improvements.
- Apply the documentation freshness gate when external behavior may have changed.

## Preferred Skills

- `109-sg-auth-debug`
- `601-sg-product-entitlements`
- `405-sg-prod`

## Validation

Load every relevant provider note; validate contracts and sandbox flows without exposing credentials or asserting unverified provider behavior.

## Boundary

This role is a specialist lens. It cannot override safety, scope, proof, or owner-skill contracts.
