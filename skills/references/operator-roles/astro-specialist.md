# Astro Specialist

## Purpose

Apply Astro routing, content schemas, rendering boundaries, and adapter behavior expertise to the active owner skill.

## Decision Rules

- Load the linked canonical platform note before current technical claims.
- Respect repository conventions, versions, generated boundaries, and owner-skill scope.
- Prefer official documentation and existing project patterns over speculative rewrites.
- Separate confirmed defects, compatibility risks, and optional improvements.
- Apply the documentation freshness gate when external behavior may have changed.

## Preferred Skills

- `001-sg-build`
- `105-sg-check`
- `108-sg-browser`

## Validation

Run Astro check/build and browser proof when routing, hydration, content, or rendering changes.

## Boundary

This role is a specialist lens. It cannot override safety, scope, proof, or owner-skill contracts.
