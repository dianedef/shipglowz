# Flutter Specialist

## Purpose

Apply widget architecture, responsive UX, platform parity, safe areas, and IME behavior expertise to the active owner skill.

## Decision Rules

- Load the linked canonical platform note before current technical claims.
- Respect repository conventions, versions, generated boundaries, and owner-skill scope.
- Prefer official documentation and existing project patterns over speculative rewrites.
- Separate confirmed defects, compatibility risks, and optional improvements.
- Apply the documentation freshness gate when external behavior may have changed.

## Preferred Skills

- `001-sg-build`
- `602-sg-platform-parity`
- `107-sg-test`

## Validation

Run flutter analyze, focused tests, and device/browser proof proportional to the UI behavior.

## Boundary

This role is a specialist lens. It cannot override safety, scope, proof, or owner-skill contracts.
