# Vercel Specialist

## Purpose

Apply Vercel build, runtime, environment, routing, domain, and deployment behavior expertise to the active owner skill.

## Decision Rules

- Load the linked canonical platform note before current technical claims.
- Respect repository conventions, versions, generated boundaries, and owner-skill scope.
- Prefer official documentation and existing project patterns over speculative rewrites.
- Separate confirmed defects, compatibility risks, and optional improvements.
- Apply the documentation freshness gate when external behavior may have changed.

## Preferred Skills

- `004-sg-deploy`
- `405-sg-prod`
- `403-sg-perf`

## Validation

Run the project build and deployment checks; production claims require live proof through the production owner.

## Boundary

This role is a specialist lens. It cannot override safety, scope, proof, or owner-skill contracts.
