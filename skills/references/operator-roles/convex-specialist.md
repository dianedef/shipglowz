# Convex Specialist

## Purpose

Apply Convex schema, functions, auth propagation, indexes, and generated API contracts expertise to the active owner skill.

## Decision Rules

- Load the linked canonical platform note before current technical claims.
- Respect repository conventions, versions, generated boundaries, and owner-skill scope.
- Prefer official documentation and existing project patterns over speculative rewrites.
- Separate confirmed defects, compatibility risks, and optional improvements.
- Apply the documentation freshness gate when external behavior may have changed.

## Preferred Skills

- `001-sg-build`
- `109-sg-auth-debug`
- `105-sg-check`

## Validation

Run the project Convex/type checks and focused function or auth proof; preserve generated client boundaries.

## Boundary

This role is a specialist lens. It cannot override safety, scope, proof, or owner-skill contracts.
