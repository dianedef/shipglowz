# App Blueprints

## Purpose

Blueprints are **global spec skeletons** for recurring app archetypes. They pre-fill stack decisions, data models, route structure, folder conventions, and architectural patterns so that `001-sg-build` does not navigate blindly when asked to create a new application.

A blueprint is not a full spec — it is an **app anatomy reference** that:
- Tells `001-sg-build` what kind of app this is and what patterns it follows
- Feeds `100-sg-spec` with a pre-filled architecture section
- Guides `306-sg-scaffold` with folder structure, naming conventions, and file patterns
- Gives `204-sg-market-study` a target archetype for research scoping

## Distribution Model

Each blueprint lives in its own GitHub repository so it survives independently of ShipGlowz.

`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/app-blueprints/` holds:
- `README.md` — the **registry**: maps blueprint IDs to their GitHub repo URLs and keywords
- `<blueprint-id>/blueprint.md` — optional local cache of a cloned blueprint (for offline or ShipGlowz-cloned setups)
- `<blueprint-id>/references/` — optional supplementary files

When ShipGlowz is installed via the Codex plugin without a full clone, only the registry (`README.md`) ships with the plugin. The Blueprint Gate clones blueprints on demand from their GitHub repos.

## Resolution Order

The Blueprint Gate resolves a blueprint in this order:

1. **Local cache**: `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/app-blueprints/<id>/blueprint.md` exists → use it
2. **External repo**: registry lists `source.repo` → `git clone --depth 1 <repo> <cache-dir>/<id>/` → use it
3. **No match**: proceed without blueprint (normal for novel app types)

The cache directory defaults to `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/app-blueprints/`. If ShipGlowz is not cloned (`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT` unavailable), use `$HOME/.shipflow/blueprints/` as fallback cache.

## Registry Format

`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/app-blueprints/README.md` is the canonical registry. It uses YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
available_blueprints:
  flutter-crud-content:
    name: Flutter CRUD Content App
    description: For apps with auth, entity list/detail/edit, offline queue
    match_keywords: [content, crud, carnet, gestion, flutter, mobile]
    source:
      repo: https://github.com/dianedefores/shipflow-blueprint-flutter-crud-content
      local: flutter-crud-content  # subdirectory name, if ShipGlowz is cloned
```

Fields:
- `name`: human-readable display name
- `description`: one-line summary
- `match_keywords`: list of keywords for fuzzy matching against user requests
- `source.repo`: GitHub repo URL (the durable home of this blueprint)
- `source.local`: subdirectory name under `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/app-blueprints/` when locally cached

## Blueprint Format

Every blueprint MUST have YAML frontmatter for machine parsing plus a Markdown body for human reading. The frontmatter includes the same `id`, `name`, `version`, `match_keywords`, `stack`, and `sources` fields.

Body sections:
1. **App Anatomy** — what this archetype does, who it serves, typical screens
2. **Stack** — framework, state, routing, HTTP, auth, storage, architecture style
3. **Models** — domain entities with fields, types, required/optional
4. **Routes** — route patterns, shell vs standalone, auth guard logic
5. **Conventions** — folder structure, naming, file patterns, code patterns
6. **Theme** — theming approach, responsive breakpoints
7. **States** — standard state handling (loading, empty, error, offline)

## Matching

When `001-sg-build` receives a request like "crée une app de carnet de santé pour voiture":

1. Normalize the request to keywords: `[carnet, santé, voiture, health, log, vehicle]`
2. Scan the registry (`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/app-blueprints/README.md`) for matching blueprints — match against `match_keywords`, `name`, and `description` (fuzzy, case-insensitive)
3. For each match found in the registry, resolve it (local cache → clone from repo)
4. If no match in registry, scan local `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/app-blueprints/*/blueprint.md` as fallback
5. Return the best match or a shortlist; if no match, proceed without blueprint
6. If multiple blueprints could match, ask the user to choose

## Blueprint Repo Structure

Each GitHub repo for a blueprint follows this layout:

```
shipflow-blueprint-<id>/
  README.md                 # Blueprint overview + link to source app
  blueprint.md              # The blueprint (primary file, follows format above)
  references/               # Optional: patterns, examples, templates
  source/                   # Optional: link to the source app that validated this
```

The repo's `README.md` serves as the public face. ShipGlowz reads only `blueprint.md`.

## Creating a New Blueprint

1. Ship an app of the new archetype.
2. Extract its repeatable patterns into a `blueprint.md`.
3. Create a GitHub repo: `shipflow-blueprint-<id>`.
4. Push `blueprint.md` + optional `references/` to the repo.
5. Add the entry to `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/app-blueprints/README.md` registry.
6. Optionally clone it locally for offline use.

## How Skills Consume Blueprints

### 001-sg-build

The Blueprint Gate fires after `existing chantier check` and before `spec/readiness loop`:

```
intake -> chantier check -> BLUEPRINT GATE -> spec/readiness -> governance -> model routing -> start -> verify -> end -> ship
```

At the Blueprint Gate:
1. Match keywords against the registry.
2. Resolve each candidate (local → clone from repo).
3. Load the best-matching blueprint into the active context.
4. Add `Blueprint: [id] (v[version])` to the final report.
5. Pass `BLUEPRINT_PATH` to downstream skills via handoff context.

### 100-sg-spec

When a blueprint is loaded:
- Pre-fill the `Architecture`, `Stack`, and `Data Model` sections of the spec.
- Use the blueprint's model list as the starting point for domain entities.
- Use the blueprint's route structure as the navigation skeleton.
- The author still owns refinement and project-specific decisions.

### 306-sg-scaffold

When a blueprint is loaded:
- Use `conventions.folder_structure` and `conventions.naming` to decide where and how to place files.
- Use the model list to scaffold data classes and services.
- Use the route list to scaffold screens and their shell/guard wrappers.
- Do not invent patterns not present in the blueprint or the project.

### 204-sg-market-study

When a blueprint is loaded:
- Use `app_type` to scope research to the relevant platform.
- Use `stack` to identify ecosystem competitors.
- Use the blueprint description as the "product category" for demand/keyword research.

## Blueprint Extraction Workflow

Use this workflow when the request is to create a new blueprint from an existing app (e.g. "extract a blueprint from ContentGlowz", "create a blueprint from ce projet").

### Trigger

`009-sg-skill-build` (ShipGlowz skill-build / internal artifact maintenance) owns this workflow. Route here from `000-shipglowz` when the intake contains keywords like `extract`, `blueprint from`, `create blueprint`, `nouveau blueprint`, or equivalent. This is **not** an end-user flow — it maintains ShipGlowz's own blueprint registry.

### Steps

1. **Identify source** — determine the app path or GitHub repo that validates the blueprint. This must be a shipped, working app.
2. **Explore app anatomy** — read the project structure, main entry points, router, state management, models, services, theme, and conventions. Use `306-sg-scaffold` exploration patterns.
3. **Extract stack** — document framework, SDK version, state management, routing, HTTP, auth, storage, architecture style, codegen status.
4. **Extract conventions** — document folder structure, naming, file patterns, model pattern, screen pattern, provider organization, theme system, responsive breakpoints.
5. **Write `blueprint.md`** — follow the Format section above (frontmatter + body sections). Include `source_repo` pointing to the app's repo.
6. **Register** — add the new blueprint to `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/app-blueprints/README.md` registry with `source.repo` URL.
7. **Create GitHub repo** — recommend creating `shipflow-blueprint-<id>` repo and pushing the blueprint there. Point `source.repo` to it.
8. **Validate** — the blueprint must be self-consistent: every convention documented must match the source app. If in doubt, re-read the source.

### Output

```
Blueprint extracted: <id> (v<version>)
Source: <app path or repo>
Repo: <source.repo URL>
Registry: $SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/app-blueprints/README.md
Next: push to GitHub repo, or use locally.
```
