# Skill Instruction Layering

## Purpose

Define where ShipGlowz skill instructions belong so skill bodies stay compact without losing operational guardrails.

## Top-Level `SKILL.md` Contract

`SKILL.md` is the activation contract: keep it short, directive, and decision-oriented. Put detailed playbooks, examples, checklists, matrices, and edge cases in references.

Each `SKILL.md` must stay independently understandable after required references are loaded.

Required local sections:

1. Role and invocation contract (`707-name`, `description`, args hints).
2. `Canonical Paths` loader.
3. `Trace category` and `Process role` when chantier tracking applies.
4. Report mode contract and pointer to `skills/references/reporting-contract.md`.
5. Mode or route detection.
6. Local stop conditions and validation commands.
7. Explicit list of required references and when each one must be loaded.

The top-level skill body must prioritize first-screen clarity over exhaustive examples or narrative rationale.

## What Must Stay Local

Keep these elements in `SKILL.md` even when a reference exists:

- Skill role and scope boundaries.
- Non-negotiable stop conditions specific to this skill.
- Result semantics or verdict semantics that downstream lifecycle skills depend on.
- Routing choices that decide which reference to load.
- Any section labels mechanically checked by downstream workflows.
- The minimum reference-loading map needed to know which detail file applies.

Never remove `Trace category`, `Process role`, chantier routing visibility, canonical-paths loading, reporting-contract loading, redaction/security gates, or documentation-update gates just to reduce lines.

## What Moves To Shared References

Use `skills/references/*.md` for doctrine reused across multiple skills:

- chantier and lifecycle doctrine
- reporting formats
- canonical path resolution
- documentation freshness rules
- development mode / validation surface rules
- Sentry and observability expectations
- cross-skill language and metadata doctrine

Do not copy large shared doctrine blocks into multiple skill bodies.

## Reference-First Skill Rule

For any skill-creation or skill-improvement task, start by checking whether the requested behavior belongs in a shared reference before touching a local `SKILL.md`.

Default order:

1. improve the canonical shared reference when the doctrine could apply to more than one skill
2. update the owner skill only to point to, narrow, or adapt that shared doctrine locally
3. edit a local `SKILL.md` directly only when the rule is genuinely owner-specific, activation-critical, or cannot be expressed safely at the reference layer

Do not use local skill edits or a brand-new skill body as the first response to a general execution-quality critique when the underlying issue is doctrinal.

When code, references, and local skill wording are all plausible targets, repair the highest reusable canonical layer first.

When the trigger is a conversation failure, operator frustration, or execution critique, extract the reusable failure class before editing. Do not stop at "make this skill better for this one case" if the same doctrine gap could mislead other skills.

## What Moves To Skill-Local References

Use `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/<skill>/references/*.md` for long, skill-specific detail:

- domain checklists and scoring matrices
- long mode playbooks
- extended examples
- migration checklists
- large report templates
- edge-case catalogs and troubleshooting branches

Local references should be split by purpose. Avoid creating one new mega-reference.

## Compaction Rule

When a local instruction grows past activation, route it by type:

| Keep in `SKILL.md` | Move to references |
| --- | --- |
| Trigger, mission, scope, required loaders, stop conditions, validation commands, report mode, and local non-negotiables | Examples, rationale, mode playbooks, scoring tables, provider matrices, migration steps, troubleshooting trees, and long templates |

If moving detail would make the activation contract ambiguous, keep the stricter local sentence and move only the supporting detail.

## Exception Policy For Long Skills

If a pilot skill still exceeds 500 lines after safe extraction:

1. Keep the stricter local guardrail.
2. Document why compaction would be unsafe.
3. Record the exception in the active chantier/spec report.
4. Optionally substitute a fallback pilot from the approved list when required by the spec.

Safety beats line-count reduction.

## Followability Gate

Every skill modification must pass two questions before completion: does the change prevent the target failure, and can a fresh agent still identify and follow the next required action from the activation body? If the answer is only achieved by adding more prose, move the doctrine to the narrowest shared reference, keep one local directive, and add a mechanical or scenario-first check instead of another warning block.

## Validation After Compaction

Always run:

```bash
python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown
tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh --check --all
```

For changed references and docs with frontmatter:

```bash
python3 tools/shipglowz_metadata_lint.py <changed-artifacts>
```

Use focused `rg` checks to verify mandatory labels and shared-reference links remain visible in compacted skill bodies.

## Integration Notes

- Do not rename skill directories, `name:` fields, or invocation keys during compaction.
- Resolve ShipGlowz-owned references from `${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-$HOME/shipglowz}`.
- Keep reports concise for users, detailed only when explicit handoff or blocked state requires it.
