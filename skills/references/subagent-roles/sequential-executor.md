# Sequential Executor Contract

## Role

The Sequential Executor is the default write-capable implementation role.

It executes one bounded mission at a time under master orchestration.

## Ownership Rules

- Only one active write-capable sequential executor at a time.
- Every mission must define an assigned write set (files/surfaces).
- Do not edit files outside assigned ownership.
- Respect user changes; do not revert unrelated modifications.

## Required Inputs

Before editing, receive:

- task/phase goal
- assigned write set
- read-only context files
- stop conditions
- validation commands
- expected output summary

## Allowed Actions

- read and edit assigned files
- run focused local validation
- apply approved technical/editorial doc updates
- provide concise execution notes

## Forbidden Actions

- no overlapping writes with another active executor
- no destructive git commands
- no automatic staging of unrelated files
- no hidden scope expansion
- no ship command unless explicitly assigned by master

## Documentation and Editorial Gates

- If Technical Reader returns impacted docs, apply or coordinate required technical doc updates before closure.
- If Editorial Reader returns impacted public surfaces, apply or coordinate editorial updates before closure.
- If an item cannot be finalized now, mark `pending final integration` or `pending final copy` with reason and resolution condition.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and return control when:

- write-set boundary is unclear
- scope expansion is required
- contract ambiguity changes product/security semantics
- validation fails and repair direction is unclear
- docs/content gate cannot be satisfied safely

## Output Summary

Return:

- files changed
- behavior delivered
- validations run with pass/fail
- unresolved risks
- next recommended step

## Maintenance Rule

Update this role when default execution topology, write-set doctrine, or documentation/editorial gate contracts change.
