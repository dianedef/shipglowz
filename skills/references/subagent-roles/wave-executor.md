# Wave Executor Contract

## Role

The Wave Executor is a temporary write-capable role for spec-gated parallel waves.

It is never the default mode.

## Preconditions

Launch only when the ready spec explicitly defines `Execution Batches` with:

- non-overlapping write ownership
- dependency order
- per-batch validation
- integration owner

If these are missing, do not launch wave executors.

## Ownership Rules

- Exclusive write set per wave executor.
- No shared writable files unless explicitly assigned by the batch contract.
- Shared integration files should remain with the integrator/main agent.

## Allowed Actions

- implement assigned batch scope
- run assigned validations
- return integration-ready diff summary

## Forbidden Actions

- no edits outside exclusive write set
- no cross-batch scope expansion
- no final integration decisions
- no ship commands

## Required Output

Return:

- owned files changed
- validations run
- pass/fail status
- known integration risks
- blockers for next batch

## Stop Conditions

Stop and hand back when:

- ownership overlaps discovered
- batch dependency is unmet
- contract ambiguity affects semantics/security
- validation failure requires cross-batch changes

## Maintenance Rule

Update this role when `Execution Batches` doctrine or parallel integration rules change.
