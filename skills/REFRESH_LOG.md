# Skills Refresh Log

Chronological log of skill refreshes via `/307-sg-skills-refresh`. Most recent first.

## 2026-07-16 — 309-sg-tasks

**Added:**
- [sessions rename] Explicit current-conversation rename with canonical status, semantic-title validation, exact-cwd isolation, and UUID provenance

**Updated:**
- [documentation] Owner contract, playbook, README, operator guide, help catalog, changelog, and editorial roadmap expose `sessions rename <status>` and its no-tracker boundary
- [public surface] The `sg-tasks` public skill page documents the current-session mode and exact-cwd limitation

**New phases:**
- Current-thread-only rename through the guarded ShipGlowz helper

**Sources:** 0 URLs consulted (operator decision and local Codex SQLite behavior)

## 2026-07-16 — 309-sg-tasks

**Added:**
- [sessions] Exact-`cwd` handling for directories without a tracker, without synthetic governance creation
- [sessions] High-confidence same-subject deduplication that keeps only the most recently active session open
- [sessions] Session-only `done` cleanup after more than 30 days of inactivity, excluding the current thread
- [sessions prune] Dry-run-first project cleanup with exact cwd confirmation, native Codex deletion, active-thread protection, subtree safety, and post-delete verification

**Updated:**
- [status safety] Duplicate and inactivity closure no longer imply that a linked project task is complete
- [documentation] Session-mode playbook, README, and public skill page aligned with the new contract
- [destructive safety] Separate fail-closed edge/job/item status domains, canonical SQLite-home alignment, and retryable partial-failure reporting

- Stop conditions for missing declared blog/article surfaces, unsupported sensitive claims, runtime content schema violations, validation failures, and unrelated dirty ship scope
- Public skill page and internal discoverability updates for content-management work

## 2026-05-03 — 002-sg-maintain

**Added:**
- New project maintenance orchestrator for bugs, dependency posture, docs drift, checks, audits, migrations, tasks, and security posture

- `security` mode that composes `402-sg-deps` and `401-sg-audit-code` instead of introducing a separate security audit skill
- Public skill page and internal discoverability updates for recurring maintenance work

**Updated:**
- Workflow/help docs now position `002-sg-maintain` as the recurring maintenance entrypoint for existing projects

- Stop conditions for missing bug files, unsafe closure, unresolved high/critical ship risk, sensitive evidence, destructive production actions, and preview-validation gaps
- Public skill page and internal discoverability updates for the professional bug lifecycle workflow

**Updated:**
- Compact descriptions for selected existing skills so adding `003-sg-bug` keeps discovery budget under the hard limit

- Explicit ownership boundaries so `004-sg-deploy` does not duplicate `005-sg-ship`, `405-sg-prod`, browser proof, manual QA, or verification internals
- Stop conditions for ambiguous scope, failed checks, blocked ship, failed deploy, missing evidence, failed verification, stale docs, unrelated dirty files, and sensitive evidence
- Public skill page and internal discoverability updates for the release confidence workflow

## 2026-05-01 — project development mode doctrine

**Added:**
- Shared reference — `project-development-mode.md` defines local, Vercel preview-push, and hybrid validation modes
- `305-sg-init` — project-local `## ShipGlowz Development Mode` section for `CLAUDE.md` / `SHIPFLOW.md`
- `102-sg-start` — execution contract now records development mode and routes preview-push validation to `005-sg-ship` -> `405-sg-prod`
- `106-sg-fix` — bug retest routing now respects local vs Vercel preview-push validation
- `005-sg-ship` — successful push now hands off to `405-sg-prod` when preview deployment is the validation surface
- `405-sg-prod` — Vercel MCP is primary for waiting on matching preview deployments in preview-push mode
- `107-sg-test` — preview/manual tests are blocked until changed code is shipped and `405-sg-prod` confirms deployment
- `302-sg-help` — global doctrine now explains project development modes and the preview-push sequence
- `109-sg-auth-debug` — auth diagnostics now respect project development mode and require `005-sg-ship` -> `405-sg-prod` before authoritative Vercel preview auth proof
- `103-sg-verify` — ready-to-ship verdicts now account for project development mode and required Vercel preview proof
- `104-sg-end` — closeout now stays partial when required preview-push validation evidence is missing
- `105-sg-check` — local checks now report when they are only pre-push confidence before `005-sg-ship` -> `405-sg-prod`

**Updated:**
- `405-sg-prod` pending rule now points to the full polling loop instead of a shorter fixed wait
- READMEs for `102-sg-start`, `106-sg-fix`, `005-sg-ship`, and `405-sg-prod` mention development-mode-aware routing
- `109-sg-auth-debug` README and Vercel tooling reference now distinguish local auth evidence from preview/prod-authoritative evidence
- READMEs for `103-sg-verify`, `104-sg-end`, and `105-sg-check` now mention development-mode-aware evidence limits
