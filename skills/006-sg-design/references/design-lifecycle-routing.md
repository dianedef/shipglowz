# Design Lifecycle Routing

## Purpose

Define how `006-sg-design` routes design work after activation.

Use this reference after loading:

- `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/decision-quality-contract.md`
- `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/design-system-token-contract.md`

## Canonical Mode Grammar

`006-sg-design` accepts these public commands: `system [scope]`, `playground [route-path]`, `audit ui [scope]`, `audit tokens [scope]`, `audit components [scope]`, `audit a11y [scope]`, `redesign [scope]`, `migration [scope]`, and the separately defined `library ...` operations. `tokens-only` and `with-playground` are optional modifiers of `system`, not public skill aliases.

`audit` without a subtype, an unknown subtype, or an invalid mode must list these supported choices or ask one targeted routing question. Never infer an audit subtype. Load only its mapped primary playbook after a valid selection; `audit ui deep` may then load the three explicit companion audit playbooks required by its contract.

`redesign` is a lifecycle route, not a hidden implementation shortcut: establish current-state evidence with `audit ui` when needed, apply the Inspiration Gate when direction changes, frame a ready spec, then route implementation and visible proof. `migration` loads the token-migration playbook, establishes design-token consumption with `audit tokens`, and uses spec-first execution for cross-surface work.

## Routing Rule

Choose the smallest safe owner: the bounded professional route that preserves centralized design tokens, brand coherence, accessibility, performance, maintainability, and proof.

Do not ask the user to choose a specialist when the request clearly names an intent. When two routes are plausible and the answer changes scope, proof, brand direction, public claim, or ship risk, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/question-contract.md` and ask one numbered decision question.

## Scope And Readiness Rules

Use direct routing for:

- read-only design audits
- one focused specialist action
- one narrow page/component fix that can be described as a mini-contract
- playground scaffolding when the token layer and route are clear

Require spec-first for:

- broad redesign
- multi-page or cross-component token migration
- new visual direction, palette, typography, or brand shift
- public/product-critical UI surfaces
- accessibility remediation across flows
- work that claims no visual regression across many pages
- changes that affect screenshots, public claims, onboarding, pricing, docs, or trust signals

Before implementation, the ready spec must name:

- user-facing outcome
- target pages/components/layouts
- design source of truth or brand docs
- intended visual change or explicit non-regression contract
- token/theme/component/source-of-truth plan for any visual dimensions, spacing, overlays, IME/keyboard behavior, or responsive layout values
- mode playbook and lifecycle or proof skills to run
- validation and browser proof obligations
- docs/editorial impact
- ship/deploy posture

## Mode And Lifecycle Sequencing

Typical flow for design-system creation:

```text
006-sg-design system -> 006-sg-design audit tokens -> 006-sg-design playground optional -> 103-sg-verify
```

Typical flow for token migration across a site:

```text
006-sg-design audit tokens -> 100-sg-spec -> 101-sg-ready -> 102-sg-start -> 105-sg-check -> 006-sg-design audit tokens -> 108-sg-browser -> 103-sg-verify -> 104-sg-end -> 005-sg-ship
```

Typical flow for visual redesign:

```text
006-sg-design audit ui -> 100-sg-spec -> 101-sg-ready -> 102-sg-start -> 105-sg-check -> 108-sg-browser -> 006-sg-design audit a11y as needed -> 103-sg-verify -> 104-sg-end -> 005-sg-ship
```

Typical flow for deep design audit:

```text
006-sg-design audit ui deep -> 100-sg-spec for chosen remediation -> 101-sg-ready -> 102-sg-start -> proof -> 103-sg-verify
```

Typical flow for accessibility-first design fix:

```text
006-sg-design audit a11y -> 100-sg-spec or 106-sg-fix depending scope -> 108-sg-browser/107-sg-test proof -> 103-sg-verify
```

For design work that changes public wording, claims, docs screenshots, page promises, or content surfaces, run the editorial/docs gates from `001-sg-build` or route to `300-sg-docs`/`007-sg-content` as needed before closure.

## Security And Safety

- Never expose private screenshots, logs, secrets, credentials, or internal operational data in design reports.
- Never weaken contrast, focus visibility, keyboard access, target size, or reduced-motion behavior to satisfy token discipline.
- Never invent a brand identity, palette, typography, or public claim when the existing project context does not support it.
- Never treat screenshots alone as sufficient proof for accessibility.
- Never ship unrelated dirty files.
