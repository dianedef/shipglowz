# Design Proof And Reporting

## Purpose

Define design proof and report details for `006-sg-design`.

Use this reference before claiming design completion, reporting blocked proof, or preparing handoff evidence.

## Proof Rule

Use project scripts and specialist checks instead of inventing proof.

Proof must match the claim:

- token or design-system claim: `006-sg-design audit tokens` and drift scan evidence
- visible UI claim: `108-sg-browser` or equivalent screenshot/browser proof for non-auth surfaces
- auth/protected UI claim: `109-sg-auth-debug`
- accessibility claim: `006-sg-design audit a11y` plus visible proof when the change is UI-facing
- hosted truth claim: `405-sg-prod` or `004-sg-deploy` before browser/auth proof when the target is unknown

Do not claim visual non-regression without browser proof. Do not claim accessibility safety from screenshots alone.

## Blocked Proof

Every blocked report must include the exact next recovery route.

For hosted/prod/deployed/provider/browser/manual proof gaps, report:

- proof type
- proof owner or lifecycle skill
- scenario
- target or environment
- reason the agent could not collect the proof

If deployment target is unknown, route first to `405-sg-prod` instead of asking the operator to inspect manually.

## User-Mode Report

Use this shape only when a design-specific report is needed in addition to the shared reporting contract:

```text
🧱 CHANTIER (local|spec) : [nom]
🎯 VERDICT (HH:mm) : [résultat]

[Résultat de conception et preuve observable]
[Limite de preuve ou de cohérence des tokens, seulement si elle compte]

[Si le chantier reste ouvert, terminer par les choix numérotés en langage
simple du contrat partagé. Ne jamais exposer un mode interne, un propriétaire
de preuve, un skill, une commande, un chemin de spec ou un flux.]
```

Agent/handoff mode may add the routing matrix decision, owned surfaces, forbidden files, validation commands, browser proof obligations, docs/editorial plan, and unresolved decisions.
