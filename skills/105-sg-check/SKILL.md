## Canonical Paths

Before resolving any ShipGlowz-owned file, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/canonical-paths.md` (`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT` defaults to `$HOME/shipglowz`). ShipGlowz tools, shared references, skill-local `references/*`, templates, workflow docs, and internal scripts must resolve from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT`, not from the project repo where the skill is running. Project artifacts and source files still resolve from the current project root unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Primary artifact type: `specialist-workflow`.

## Instruction Layering

This `SKILL.md` is the activation contract. Before editing or expanding this skill, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/skill-instruction-layering.md` and keep bulky workflow detail in references.

## Chantier Tracking

Trace category: `conditionnel`.
Process role: `source-de-chantier`.

Before producing the final report, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md` when this run is attached to a spec-first chantier. If exactly one active `specs/*.md` chantier is identified, append the current run to `Skill Run History`, update `Current Chantier Flow` when the run changes the chantier state, and open the report with the opening chantier header. If no unique chantier is identified, do not write to any spec; use a `(local)` chantier header with a short work name.

## Chantier Potential Intake

Apply the chantier-potential threshold from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md` before the final report.
For `105-sg-check`, use it when findings reveal non-trivial future work outside a direct local fix and no unique chantier already owns that work.

## Mission

`105-sg-check` answers one question: `Quels checks techniques apportent une confiance proportionnée sur cette surface ?`

Run and interpret technical checks without overstating what they prove. `105-sg-check` is a technical confidence pass, not product proof, not a browser/manual QA substitute, and not a generic bug-fix owner.

If checks generate temporary build outputs, caches, or scratch artifacts, treat them as disposable unless the project contract explicitly requires a durable artifact. Remove them after the check completes.

## ShipGlowz-Owned Preflight

Apply `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/shipglowz-owned-preflight.md` before reading ShipGlowz-owned references, running ShipGlowz-owned tools/scripts, or checking ShipGlowz-owned runtime-visibility surfaces.
For `105-sg-check`, this preflight also applies before verifying ShipGlowz skill runtime visibility targets.

## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Package manager lockfiles: !`ls -1 package-lock.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml requirements.txt Pipfile.lock 2>/dev/null || echo "none found"`
- Package.json scripts (if any): !`cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^\s+"(dev|build|lint|typecheck|check|test|format)"' || echo "no package.json"`
- ShipGlowz development mode: !`rg -n "ShipGlowz Development Mode|development_mode|validation_surface|ship_before_preview_test|post_ship_verification|deployment_provider" CLAUDE.md SHIPFLOW.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No project development mode documented"`
- Project CLAUDE.md (if any): !`head -80 CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "no CLAUDE.md"`

## Your task

Run all available checks for the current project and fix errors if found.
Treat this skill as a practical confidence pass, not as proof that the product is fully correct or secure.

Before finalizing, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/actionable-failure-contract.md` when a check fails or is blocked so the failure maps to a specific owner and impact.

Before choosing or interpreting checks, read `${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-$HOME/shipglowz}/skills/references/project-development-mode.md` and inspect `CLAUDE.md` or `SHIPFLOW.md`.
- In `local` mode, local checks are the expected technical confidence pass.
- In `vercel-preview-push` mode, local checks are pre-push confidence only. Apply `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/preview-proof-routing.md` before claiming preview/browser/manual validation.
- In `hybrid` mode, local checks are valid for unit/static work, but hosted surfaces still need `/005-sg-ship` -> `/405-sg-prod` before remote validation.
- If Vercel is detected but the mode is missing, report `unknown-vercel` as a risky assumption and recommend documenting `## ShipGlowz Development Mode`.

### Workspace root detection

If the current directory has no project markers (no `package.json`, no `requirements.txt`, no `src/` dir) BUT contains multiple project subdirectories — you are at the **workspace root**. Use the runtime's structured question tool when available, or a concise plain-text question:
- Question: "Which project(s) should I check?"
- `multiSelect: true`
- One option per project: label = project name, description = stack
- Read project list from local project discovery (`shipglowz_data/` markers); use old registry files only as manually supplied migration evidence.

Then run checks for each selected project sequentially.

Shared tracking files are read-only in this skill:
- `PROJECTS.md` is legacy/migration evidence only; it is not required for workspace checks.
- Never edit `TASKS.md`, `AUDIT_LOG.md`, or `PROJECTS.md` from `105-sg-check`.

### Step 0: Choose which checks to run

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty (not "fix" or "nofix"), use the runtime's structured question tool when available, or a concise plain-text question:
- Question: "Which checks should I run?"
- `multiSelect: true`
- Options:
  - **Typecheck** — "TypeScript/Astro type validation"
  - **Lint** — "ESLint, formatting, style rules"
  - **Build** — "Full production build"
  - **Test** — "Unit/integration tests"
  - **Dependencies** — "Quick vulnerability + outdated check (run /010-sg-technical deps for full audit)"
- All options pre-selected by default

If `$ARGUMENTS` is "fix" or "nofix", run all detected checks (skip the prompt).

### Step 1: Detect project type and run checks

Based on the context above, identify the project stack and run the appropriate commands **sequentially** (each depends on the previous passing):

**TypeScript/JavaScript projects** (has package.json):
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck` or `yarn typecheck` or `pnpm typecheck` (match the lockfile)
- Lint: `npm run lint` or equivalent (if script exists)
- Build: `npm run build` or `pnpm build` or `yarn build`

**Astro projects** (has astro in dependencies):
- `pnpm check` or `npm run check` (Astro type checking)
- `pnpm build` or `npm run build`

**Python projects** (has requirements.txt or Pipfile):
- `python -m py_compile` on changed files, or `pytest --co -q` (collect-only) to validate
- `pytest -x` (stop on first failure)

**Bash projects** (shell scripts, no package.json):
- `bash -n` syntax check on `.sh` files
- Run test scripts if they exist (`./test_*.sh`)

### Proportional checks policy

Prefer scoped checks for low-risk edits. Do not default to a full sequence when the risk and touched surface are narrow.

- `bounded`: default for localized or low-risk edits (syntax/typecheck/lint where available and targeted).
- `full`: for behavior-relevant shared code, auth/data boundary changes, dependency/build changes, or release-risky edits.

Never run full framework-heavy checks purely by habit.

**ShipGlowz skill runtime visibility** (when the scope touches `skills/*/SKILL.md`, new/renamed skills, or reported Claude/Codex skill drift):
- Check one skill: `${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-$HOME/shipglowz}/tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh --check --skill <name>`
- Check all source skills: `${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-$HOME/shipglowz}/tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh --check --all`
- Report missing/stale/non-symlink entries; do not repair unless the user asked for fix mode and the current task owns runtime visibility repair.

Before concluding that the project is "green", explicitly note any major gap in coverage:
- No tests available
- No typecheck available on a typed codebase
- No lint script on a repo that normally uses linting
- Build skipped because no build command exists
- Checks only validate syntax/compile steps, not runtime behavior or user-facing flows
- Project mode requires Vercel preview evidence and only local checks were run

If project scripts in `CLAUDE.md` or `package.json` suggest an expected check exists but it cannot be run, report that as a risky assumption instead of silently skipping it.

### Step 1b: Check dependencies (if selected) — quick scan only

> For comprehensive dependency auditing (unused deps, license compliance, type coverage, supply chain), run `/010-sg-technical deps`.

**Node.js projects** (has package.json):
- Run `npm audit --audit-level=high` / `yarn audit` / `pnpm audit` — report critical/high vulnerabilities only
- Run `npm outdated` / `yarn outdated` / `pnpm outdated` — show summary count (X patch, Y minor, Z major)

**Python projects** (has requirements.txt):
- Run `pip-audit` if available — report critical/high vulnerabilities only
- Run `pip list --outdated` — show summary count

Report a quick summary. Do NOT auto-update dependencies. Recommend `/010-sg-technical deps` for full analysis (unused, duplicates, licenses, configuration).

Do not present a clean dependency scan as a security sign-off. If dependency checks were not available, required auth to registry services, or only partial results were obtained, state that explicitly.

### Step 2: Fix errors

If `$ARGUMENTS` is "nofix", stop here and just report the errors.

Otherwise (default behavior, including when `$ARGUMENTS` is "fix" or empty):

1. Read each error message carefully.
2. Open the failing file(s) and fix the root cause.
3. Re-run the failed check to confirm the fix works.
4. Repeat until all checks pass or you've attempted 3 fix cycles.

Do not "fix" a failing check by weakening the intended guardrail unless the user explicitly asked for that tradeoff. In particular:
- Do not disable lint/type/test/build rules just to get green output
- Do not replace meaningful assertions with trivial ones
- Do not remove validation, auth, authorization, or error handling paths to silence failures
- If a passing result depends on a risky assumption, surface it in the report

### Step 3: Report

Summarize what was checked, what failed, and what was fixed. If anything still fails after 3 attempts, explain the remaining errors clearly so the user can decide what to do.

Always include a short `Risky assumptions / gaps` section when any of the following is true:
- a relevant check was unavailable or skipped
- the repo has no meaningful runtime or integration coverage
- a dependency/security check could not be completed
- the build passes but warnings suggest a likely product-quality or security issue

If nothing indicates functional validation of the main user flow, say so plainly. Example: "Checks pass, but no evidence was gathered that checkout/login/sync actually works end-to-end."

If project mode is `vercel-preview-push`, include the next deployment step explicitly:
- `Next step:` apply `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/preview-proof-routing.md`
- If the checked change needs non-auth browser proof, add `/108-sg-browser [URL or scope] [objective]` after `405-sg-prod`
- If the checked change affects auth or protected flows, add `/109-sg-auth-debug [scope]` after `405-sg-prod`
- If it affects a manual user flow, add `/107-sg-test --preview [scope]` after `405-sg-prod`

### Important

- Use the correct package manager for the project (check lockfiles).
- Do not install dependencies — if something is missing, tell the user.
- Do not modify test expectations to make tests pass. Fix the actual code.
- If the project CLAUDE.md specifies custom check commands, use those instead.
- A passing `105-sg-check` run means "no obvious issues in the checks that were executed", not "product is production-ready".
- When security-relevant checks fail or are missing (for example auth flows, permission boundaries, secret/config validation, dependency audit access), call that out explicitly and recommend the next skill when appropriate (`/103-sg-verify`, `/405-sg-prod`, `/010-sg-technical deps`).
- When browser-observable behavior is unproven but the issue is not auth-specific, recommend `/108-sg-browser [URL or scope] [objective]` rather than stretching `/109-sg-auth-debug`.
- In `vercel-preview-push` or relevant `hybrid` mode, apply `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/preview-proof-routing.md` when changed behavior needs preview validation.
