description: "Close tasks with summaries, trackers, and changelog prep."
argument-hint: [optional summary or notes]
---

Primary artifact type: `specialist-workflow`.

## Canonical Paths

Before resolving any ShipGlowz-owned file, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/canonical-paths.md` (`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT` defaults to `$HOME/shipglowz`). ShipGlowz tools, shared references, skill-local `references/*`, templates, workflow docs, and internal scripts must resolve from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT`, not from the project repo where the skill is running. Project artifacts and source files still resolve from the current project root unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Instruction Layering

This `SKILL.md` is the activation contract. Keep closure semantics here; task-row mechanics and changelog detail should stay as concise as possible.

## Chantier Tracking

Trace category: `obligatoire`.
Process role: `lifecycle`.

Before closing a spec-first chantier, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md`, then read the spec's `Skill Run History` and `Current Chantier Flow` when a unique spec exists. Append a current `104-sg-end` row with result `closed`, `deferred`, `blocked`, or `not applicable`, update `Current Chantier Flow`, and end the report with the compact `Chantier` block from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/reporting-contract.md`. If no unique spec is available, do not write to a spec; report `Chantier: non applicable` or `Chantier: non trace` with the reason.

## Report Modes

Before producing the final report, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/reporting-contract.md`.

Default to `report=user`: concise, outcome-first, and using the compact chantier block. The detailed report template below is for `report=agent`, blocked runs, or explicit handoff.

## Required References

Before tracker closure, changelog framing, or done/closed wording, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/closure-archive-guard.md`.

## Mission

`104-sg-end` closes the current work session: summary, tracker updates, changelog prep, and explicit next work. It owns closure bookkeeping, not implementation proof or git shipping.

`104-sg-end` answers one question:

```text
What can be closed in trackers and changelog framing now without overstating proof or ship status?
```

If the next unresolved owner is still proof, stay with `103-sg-verify`. If the next unresolved owner is git shipping, route to `005-sg-ship` after closure bookkeeping instead of absorbing ship behavior here.

## ShipGlowz-Owned Preflight

Apply `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/shipglowz-owned-preflight.md` before reading ShipGlowz-owned references, mutating ShipGlowz-owned tracker/spec surfaces, or running ShipGlowz-owned tools/scripts.
For `104-sg-end`, this preflight also applies before closure writes that affect ShipGlowz-owned workflow state.

## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Current date: !`date '+%Y-%m-%d'`
- Project name: !`basename $(pwd)`
- Git branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`
- Git status: !`git status --short 2>/dev/null || echo "Not a git repo"`
- Git diff stat: !`git diff HEAD --stat 2>/dev/null || echo "no changes"`
- Recent commits (this session): !`git log --oneline -10 2>/dev/null || echo "no commits"`
- ShipGlowz development mode: !`rg -n "ShipGlowz Development Mode|development_mode|validation_surface|ship_before_preview_test|post_ship_verification|deployment_provider" CLAUDE.md SHIPFLOW.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No project development mode documented"`
- Project-local TASKS.md: !`cat shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md 2>/dev/null || cat TASKS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No project-local TASKS.md"`
- Local TASKS.md (if exists): !`cat TASKS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No local TASKS.md"`
- Existing CHANGELOG: !`head -30 CHANGELOG.md 2>/dev/null || echo "no CHANGELOG.md"`

## Your task

Wrap up the current task. Summarize, update tracking files, but do NOT commit or push.
This skill closes a work session, not product truth. `TASKS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` are bookkeeping, not proof that the outcome is fully correct, complete, secure, or shipped.

### Step 1 — Summarize what was done (internal)

From the conversation, identify:
- What was completed
- What was started but not finished
- Key files modified (from git diff)
- Any decisions worth noting
- The user story or user-facing outcome this work was intended to support, if inferable
- Any gap between "work performed" and "outcome proven"
- Documentation surfaces updated or possibly stale after the change
- Project development mode from `${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-$HOME/shipglowz}/skills/references/project-development-mode.md` and `CLAUDE.md` / `SHIPFLOW.md`
- Whether required preview deployment evidence exists (`005-sg-ship` pushed, `405-sg-prod` confirmed, and preview test/auth proof collected when needed)
- Whether any source-of-truth delta remains unsynced before closure: tracker, changelog, docs, bug file, spec, public copy, skill runtime links, or archive target

### Step 1.5 — Closure mode decision

If completion status is ambiguous, use the runtime's structured question tool when available, or a concise plain-text question:
- Question: "Quel mode de clôture veux-tu ?"
- `multiSelect: false`
- Options:
  - **Clôture complète** — "Marquer la tâche en done"
  - **Clôture partielle (recommandé si doute)** — "Garder un reliquat en in progress"
  - **Résumé seulement** — "Ne pas toucher TASKS/CHANGELOG, juste rapporter"

Ask a targeted clarification instead of assuming `done` when:
- the work is implemented but not meaningfully validated
- the project is `vercel-preview-push` and the work still needs deployed proof governed by `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/preview-proof-routing.md`
- the project is `hybrid` and the changed surface depends on hosted auth/OAuth, webhooks, env vars, serverless/edge, Vercel routing, or preview/prod data without confirmed preview evidence
- the user story or expected outcome is still unclear
- the work touches auth, permissions, billing, secrets, tenant boundaries, destructive actions, migrations, public flows, or other security-sensitive surfaces
- there are remaining risks, TODOs, or blockers that materially affect product coherence or safety
- docs, README, FAQ, onboarding, changelog, examples, pricing or support copy may still describe old behavior

Examples:
- "Est-ce que tu veux clôturer la tâche comme livrée fonctionnellement, ou la laisser partielle tant que le flow utilisateur n’est pas validé ?"
- "Cette passe touche la sécurité / visibilité des données. Veux-tu une clôture partielle avec risques restants explicites ?"

### Step 2 — Update TASKS.md (silent)

Using the master TASKS.md from context:
- Before creating or mutating task operational records, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/operational-record-format.md` and follow it for new `TASKS.md` writes.
- Mark completed items: `🔄 in progress` → `✅ done` and `📋 todo` → `✅ done`
- Mark partially done items: `📋 todo` → `🔄 in progress` with a note
- Add new tasks discovered during the work
- Update project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md` when task closure changes local workflow state.
- If a local `TASKS.md` also exists, update both
- Treat the TASKS content loaded in Context as informational only.
- Immediately before editing either TASKS file, re-read it from disk and use that version as authoritative.
- Apply a minimal targeted edit to the relevant rows only; never rewrite the whole file from stale context.
- If the expected row or section moved, re-read once and recompute; if it is still ambiguous, stop and ask the user.
- If the evidence supports only partial completion, keep or move the task to `🔄 in progress` with a short note rather than forcing `✅ done`.
- If preview-push validation is required but missing, do not mark the task `✅ done`; keep it `🔄 in progress` with a note such as `awaiting preview-proof route`.
- Reflect product coherence and safety gaps when they materially affect closure.
- Reflect documentation coherence gaps when a user-facing feature behavior changed.
- No output at this step.

If mode is **Résumé seulement**, skip this step.

### Step 3 — Update CHANGELOG.md (silent)

- Group changes into Keep a Changelog categories: Added / Changed / Fixed / Security / Removed
- Consolidate related changes into single human-readable entries
- Prepend a new `## [date]` entry to CHANGELOG.md (or update today's entry if it exists)
- Skip trivial changes (formatting, comments)
- Keep entries evidence-based and user-facing; do not claim a feature is "done", "safe", or "production ready" unless the work actually demonstrated that.
- In `vercel-preview-push` or relevant `hybrid` mode, apply `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/preview-proof-routing.md` before framing a changelog entry as functionally released/validated.
- Include documentation alignment when it materially affects user-facing behavior.
- No output at this step.

If mode is **Résumé seulement**, skip this step.

### Step 4 — Save decisions to memory (silent)

For each significant decision or discovery from Step 1, save to memory if it will be useful in future conversations. Skip if nothing meaningful.

### Step 5 — Report

Output ONE concise report:

```
## Done — [date]

**What changed:**
- [bullet per logical change — specific, not vague]

**User story / outcome:**
- [what user-facing outcome was advanced, completed, or still unproven]

**Development mode:**
- [local / vercel-preview-push / hybrid / unknown] — [validation evidence or missing preview-proof route]

**Documentation coherence:**
- [updated / not impacted / gap remains]

**Status:**
- Completed: [item], [item]
- In progress: [item — where it stands]
- Risks / evidence limits: [explicit remaining uncertainty, especially product/security]
- Decisions saved: [decision or "none"]

**Up next:**
1. [emoji] [top priority from TASKS.md]
2. [emoji] [second priority]
3. [emoji] [third priority]

[📝 Not committed — run /005-sg-ship when ready to push]

## Chantier

Skill courante: 104-sg-end
Chantier: [spec path | non applicable | non trace]
Trace spec: [ecrite | non ecrite | non applicable]
Flux:
- 100-sg-spec: [status]
- 101-sg-ready: [status]
- 102-sg-start: [status]
- 103-sg-verify: [status]
- 104-sg-end: [closed | deferred | blocked | not applicable]
- 005-sg-ship: [status]

Reste a faire:
- [item or None]

Prochaine etape:
- [/005-sg-ship puis /405-sg-prod si la validation preview-push est requise | /005-sg-ship | explicit action | None]

Verdict 104-sg-end:
- [closed | deferred | blocked | not applicable]
```

### Rules

- Do NOT commit or push — that's 005-sg-ship's job
- Do NOT output anything before Step 5 — one report only
- Keep the report under 25 lines
- If nothing was done this session, say so honestly
- Update BOTH master and local TASKS.md when both exist
- Do not let TASKS/CHANGELOG imply stronger proof than the actual validation supports
- Apply the closure archive guard before any `done`, `closed`, or archived framing.
- Do not mark feature work fully closed if known docs remain stale and materially affect users/operators
- Prefer partial closure when user-story completion or security posture remains uncertain
- Prefer partial closure when required Vercel preview validation is missing.
