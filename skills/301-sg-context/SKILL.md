## Canonical Paths

Before resolving any ShipGlowz-owned file, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/canonical-paths.md` (`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT` defaults to `$HOME/shipglowz`). ShipGlowz tools, shared references, skill-local `references/*`, templates, workflow docs, and internal scripts must resolve from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT`, not from the project repo where the skill is running. Project artifacts and source files still resolve from the current project root unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Chantier Tracking

Trace category: `non-applicable`.
Process role: `helper`.

This skill does not write to chantier specs. If invoked inside a spec-first flow, do not modify `Skill Run History`; use a `(local)` chantier header with a short work name.


## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Project name: !`basename $(pwd)`

## Your task

Prime the session context before starting work. This avoids wasting tokens on broad file exploration.

`301-sg-context` answers one priming question:

```text
What is the minimum focused context we should load before starting this known task?
```

Keep the boundary explicit: `301-sg-context` prepares context for a known task. It does not own the final route selection, execute the lifecycle work itself, or act as a repo-status dashboard.

Route away instead of staying in `301-sg-context` when the operator really needs:

- skill choice or workflow routing -> `000-shipglowz` or `302-sg-help`
- actual continuation of a resolved work item -> `706-continue`
- cross-project git/sync reporting -> `308-sg-status`

### Step 1 — Check session memory

Call `context_continue` with the user's task as the query (`$ARGUMENTS`).

Read the response carefully:
- **Files already in memory**: do NOT re-read these — use their previews
- **Decisions already stored**: incorporate these into your plan
- **Budget remaining**: note how much read budget is left this turn

### Step 2 — Retrieve relevant files

If `context_continue` shows no prior memory OR the task needs more files, call `context_retrieve` with `$ARGUMENTS` as the query.

Read the ranked file list. Pick the top 3-5 most relevant files only.

### Step 3 — Read only what you need

For each file you actually need to understand:
- Use `context_read` with the query set to `$ARGUMENTS` (enables smart excerpting)
- Skip files where the `context_continue` preview is already sufficient
- Stop reading when budget drops below 4,000 chars

### Step 4 — Report and plan

Output a concise summary:
```
## Ready to work on: [task]

**Files in context:**
- [file] — [one line on what's relevant]

**Key constraints/decisions:**
- [any stored decisions relevant to this task]

**Plan:**
1. [step]
2. [step]

**Budget used:** X / 18,000 chars
```

Then use the runtime's structured question tool when available, or a concise plain-text question:
- Question: "Le contexte est prêt. On fait quoi ?"
- `multiSelect: false`
- Options:
  - **Proceed now (recommandé)** — "Tu exécutes le plan avec ce contexte"
  - **Ajouter 1 fichier clé** — "Tu enrichis le contexte d'un seul fichier supplémentaire"
  - **Affiner la cible** — "Tu reformules la tâche avant d'aller plus loin"

### Rules

- Do NOT read files not returned by `context_retrieve` or `context_continue`
- Do NOT do Glob/Grep before Steps 1 and 2
- Do NOT read more than 5 files in this priming phase
- If the task mentions a specific file path, add it to the read list regardless of retrieve results
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user: "What do you want to work on?" before proceeding
