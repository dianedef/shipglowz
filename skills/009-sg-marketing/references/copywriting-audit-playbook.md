# Copywriting Audit Playbook

Use only for `009-sg-marketing copywriting <page|funnel|offer|project|global>`.

## Distinct Contract And Governance

Start with the intended buyer, not the text. This mode answers whether an offer persuades the right persona through a credible customer journey; it does not duplicate the clarity, grammar, microcopy, or rewrite contract of `copy`.

Read business and branding contracts and existing persona/customer-journey/strategy artifacts before scoring or persisting strategy. Report their version, status, freshness, and confidence; missing or stale contracts cap confidence and must appear as proof gaps. Public funnel/strategy changes require the editorial and technical-documentation corpus gates, including Editorial, Claim Impact, and Documentation Update Plans. Use `content-quality-rubric.md` for rubric statuses and `task-registry-routing.md` before follow-up writes.

For sales/offer, CTA/proof/objection comparison, or explicit inspiration, apply the bounded Inspiration Gate: present at most five private reference IDs, require operator selection before loading bundles, record selected IDs, and extract patterns/anti-copy constraints without reproducing source copy.

## Audit Flow

For a page, establish funnel stage and awareness level, then score:

1. persona alignment: customer vocabulary, real pain, desired outcome, trigger, alternatives, and appropriate awareness level;
2. value proposition: credible transformation, differentiation, proof, and coherence with product, pricing, onboarding, docs, emails, and support;
3. persuasion structure: hook, framework, section role, engagement progression, and appropriate length;
4. objections: the important objections before the primary CTA, empathetic treatment, relevant proof, and proportional risk reversal;
5. emotional path: empathy before solution, honest pain-to-hope-to-confidence-to-action sequence, and no coercion;
6. CTA strategy: buyer-appropriate next step, alternative for uncertainty, friction control, and proof before ask;
7. journey coherence: upstream promise, downstream handoff, micro-commitments, and no contradictions across marketing/product/docs.

For a project/global scope, validate or create a persona, map TOFU/MOFU/BOFU/retention surfaces, identify gaps/dead ends/orphan pages, assess positioning, pricing psychology, trust, and content-market fit, then prioritize strategic—not line-edit—recommendations. Select projects explicitly before global work.

## Durable Artifacts, Tracking, And Report

When the user asks for persistent strategy artifacts, maintain `docs/copywriting/persona.md`, `parcours-client.md`, and `strategie.md` as governed living references. Use ShipGlowz frontmatter, source evidence, dependencies on business/brand versions, `0.1.0` for unreviewed work, and semantic bumps for changed persona, promise, funnel, pricing psychology, or strategy. Update existing files narrowly and retain history; do not duplicate the full audit report.

Before traffic-first audit/task writes, load `operational-record-format.md`, re-read the target before writing, use the editorial roadmap for editorial/copywriting follow-up and execution tasks only for genuine implementation, and stop if an anchor remains ambiguous after one re-read.

Report persona, funnel position and awareness, category grades, strategic recommendations and impact confidence, proof/docs gaps, governance-plan outcomes, and next action. Evaluate `Chantier potentiel` for material persona, positioning, legal, trust, pricing, or funnel decisions.

## Stops And Ethical Bar

- Do not invent testimonials, proof, conversion results, pricing, guarantees, product capabilities, or business outcomes.
- Never recommend fake urgency, fake social proof, dark patterns, fear, guilt, or unrealistic promises; vulnerable audiences require heightened empathy and honesty.
- Keep recommendations strategic; route sentence-level repair or full rewrites to `copy` when that is the actual request.
- Match output language to the user and preserve correct French accents.
- Preserve focused contract, metadata, and budget checks after playbook changes.
