## Canonical Paths

Before resolving any ShipGlowz-owned file, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/canonical-paths.md` (`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT` defaults to `$HOME/shipglowz`). ShipGlowz tools, shared references, skill-local `references/*`, templates, workflow docs, and internal scripts must resolve from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT`, not from the project repo where the skill is running. Project artifacts and source files still resolve from the current project root unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Chantier Tracking

Trace category: `conditionnel`.
Process role: `source-de-chantier`.

Before producing the final report, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md` when this run is attached to a spec-first chantier. If exactly one active `specs/*.md` chantier is identified, append the current run to `Skill Run History`, update `Current Chantier Flow` when the run changes the chantier state, and include a final `Chantier` block. If no unique chantier is identified, do not write to any spec; report `Chantier: non applicable` or `Chantier: non trace` with the reason.

## Chantier Potential Intake

Because this skill has process role `source-de-chantier`, evaluate the standard threshold from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md` before the final report. If the findings reveal non-trivial future work and no unique chantier owns it, do not write to an existing spec; add a `Chantier potentiel` block with `oui`, `non`, or `incertain`, a proposed title, reason, severity, scope, evidence, recommended `/100-sg-spec ...` command, and next step. If the work is only a direct local fix or already belongs to the current chantier, state `Chantier potentiel: non` with the concrete reason.


## Doctrine

- Dependency health is product health: evaluate package risk in terms of user-facing outcome, operational continuity, and security exposure.
- Treat supply-chain trust as a first-class concern: integrity, provenance, install-time behavior, registry trust, token handling, and automation posture matter.
- Report risky assumptions explicitly. Quiet tooling output is not proof that runtime reachability or deployment exposure is safe.
- Keep the workflow practical: fix the highest-risk issues first and avoid churn that does not materially improve safety or coherence.

## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Project CLAUDE.md: !`head -120 CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "no CLAUDE.md"`
- Package.json: !`cat package.json 2>/dev/null | head -80 || echo "no package.json"`
- Dependencies: !`cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"(dependencies|devDependencies)"' -A 100 | head -80 || pip list 2>/dev/null | head -40 || echo "unknown"`
- Lockfile: !`ls -1 package-lock.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml requirements.txt Pipfile.lock 2>/dev/null | head -3 || echo "none"`
- Node/Python version: !`node -v 2>/dev/null; python3 --version 2>/dev/null; cat .nvmrc .python-version .node-version 2>/dev/null || echo "not pinned"`
- Security config: !`ls -1 .github/dependabot.yml renovate.json .npmrc 2>/dev/null || echo "none"`
- Project structure: !`find . -maxdepth 2 -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.astro" -o -name "*.vue" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.sh" \) 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git | grep -v dist | sort | head -40`

## Mode detection

- **`$ARGUMENTS` is "global"** → GLOBAL MODE: audit dependencies across ALL projects.
- **`$ARGUMENTS` is empty** → PROJECT MODE: full dependency audit of the current project.
- **No FILE MODE** — dependencies are project-scoped, not file-scoped.

---

## GLOBAL MODE

Audit dependencies across ALL projects in the workspace.

1. Read discovered project-local corpora (`shipglowz_data/` markers) — check the **Domain Applicability** table. Identify projects with ✓ in the Deps column. BuildFlowz (Bash) has no package manager → skip.

2. Use the runtime's structured question tool when available to let the user choose:
   - Question: "Which projects should I audit for dependency health?"
   - `multiSelect: true`
   - One option per applicable project: label = project name, description = stack inferred from project-local markers
   - All projects with package managers pre-listed

3. Use available parallel agent/tooling to launch one bounded worker per **selected** project in a single parallel batch when supported. If unavailable, run the selected projects sequentially.

   Agent prompt must include:
   - `cd [path]` then read `CLAUDE.md` for project context
   - The absolute date, exact project path, and the dependency context already surfaced by this skill (`package.json`, lockfiles, version pins, security config)
   - The complete **PROJECT MODE** section from this skill (all 8 phases)
   - The **Tracking** section from this skill
   - Rule: before scoring, identify runtime/build/test consequences of dependency changes and the linked systems they affect
   - Rule: do not ask follow-up questions; if context is missing, state assumptions / confidence limits and continue
   - Rule: call out supply-chain trust issues, product-critical dependency risk, and proof gaps explicitly
   - Required sub-report sections: `Scope understood`, `User story / critical product flows affected`, `Context read`, `Linked systems & consequences`, `Findings`, `Risky assumptions / proof gaps`, `Confidence / missing context`

4. After all agents return, compile a **cross-project dependency report**:

   ```
   GLOBAL DEPENDENCY AUDIT — [date]
   ═══════════════════════════════════════
   PROJECT SCORES
     [project]    [A/B/C/D]  —  summary
     ...
   CROSS-PROJECT PATTERNS
     [Shared vulnerabilities, duplicate libraries across projects, version inconsistencies]
   ALL ISSUES BY SEVERITY
     🔴 [project] — description
     🟠 [project] — description
     🟡 [project] — description
   Total: X critical, Y high, Z medium across N projects
   ═══════════════════════════════════════
   ```

5. Update project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/AUDIT_LOG.md` (one traffic-first audit record per project, Deps column) and project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md` (each project's `### Audit: Deps` subsection).

6. Ask: **"Which projects should I fix?"** — list projects with scores. Fix only approved projects, one at a time.

---

## PROJECT MODE

### Workspace root detection

If the current directory has no project markers (no `package.json`, no `requirements.txt`, no `src/` dir, no `lib.sh`) BUT contains multiple project subdirectories — you are at the **workspace root**, not inside a project.

Use the runtime's structured question tool when available, or a concise plain-text question:
- Question: "You're at the workspace root. Which project(s) should I audit for dependency health?"
- `multiSelect: true`
- Options:
  - **All projects** — "Run dependency audit across every project with a package manager" (Recommended)
  - One option per project from discovered project-local corpora (`shipglowz_data/` markers): label = project name, description = stack

Then proceed to **GLOBAL MODE** with the selected projects.

### PHASE 1: VULNERABILITY SCAN

Run the appropriate security audit tool:

**Node.js**: `npm audit` / `yarn audit` / `pnpm audit` (match the lockfile)
**Python**: `pip-audit` if available, or `safety check`, or `pip install pip-audit && pip-audit`

For each vulnerability found:
- [ ] CVE ID and severity (critical/high/medium/low)
- [ ] Affected package and version range
- [ ] Fix available? (patch version, or requires major upgrade)
- [ ] Transitive or direct dependency?
- [ ] Does it affect a user-critical flow, privileged path, public surface, or sensitive-data path?
- [ ] Is exploitability demonstrated, likely, limited, or unknown from available evidence?

**Supply chain checks**:
- [ ] Lockfile committed to git (`git ls-files --error-unmatch [lockfile]`)
- [ ] No unusual registry URLs in `.npmrc` or lockfile
- [ ] No `postinstall` scripts in dependencies doing suspicious things (`grep -r postinstall node_modules/*/package.json | head -20`)
- [ ] Provenance/integrity checksums present in lockfile
- [ ] No project install scripts download or execute remote code without a clear trust rationale
- [ ] No plaintext registry tokens or suspicious package-manager credentials committed in repo config
- [ ] CI/package install path does not obviously weaken integrity or trust boundaries
- [ ] Security-motivated `overrides` / `resolutions` are still necessary and documented

---

### PHASE 2: OUTDATED PACKAGES

Run the appropriate outdated check:

**Node.js**: `npm outdated` / `yarn outdated` / `pnpm outdated`
**Python**: `pip list --outdated`

Classify each outdated package:
- **Patch** (1.2.3 → 1.2.4) — safe to update, bug fixes only
- **Minor** (1.2.3 → 1.3.0) — usually safe, new features
- **Major** (1.2.3 → 2.0.0) — breaking changes, needs migration

Additional checks:
- [ ] Deprecation timeline — is the package abandoned? (no commits >2 years)
- [ ] Replacement recommendations for deprecated packages
- [ ] Framework version alignment (e.g., all React ecosystem on same major)
- [ ] Product blast radius — which user journeys, jobs, admin actions, or integrations would break if the package upgrade goes wrong?

---

### PHASE 3: UNUSED & DUPLICATE

Cross-reference installed dependencies with actual usage:

- [ ] Search for each dependency name in source files (imports/requires)
- [ ] Flag packages in `dependencies` that should be in `devDependencies` (test frameworks, build tools, linters, type packages used only in dev)
- [ ] Flag packages in `devDependencies` that should be in `dependencies` (imported by production code)
- [ ] Flag dependencies that only support dead code, abandoned flows, or scaffolding but still increase attack surface
- [ ] Detect functional duplicates — multiple libraries doing the same job:
  - HTTP clients (axios + fetch + got + node-fetch)
  - Date libraries (moment + dayjs + date-fns + luxon)
  - Validation (zod + yup + joi + valibot)
  - CSS-in-JS (styled-components + emotion + stitches)
  - State management (redux + zustand + jotai + recoil)

---

### PHASE 4: LICENSE COMPLIANCE

List all dependency licenses:

**Node.js**: `npx license-checker --summary 2>/dev/null || npx license-checker-rspack --summary 2>/dev/null` or parse from `node_modules/*/package.json`
**Python**: `pip-licenses 2>/dev/null` or parse from package metadata

- [ ] Flag copyleft licenses (GPL, AGPL, LGPL) — may be incompatible with commercial use
- [ ] Flag unknown or missing licenses
- [ ] Flag SSPL (Server Side Public License) — restrictive for SaaS
- [ ] Ensure project's own license is declared
- [ ] Flag licenses that materially conflict with the intended business model (commercial SaaS, public API, redistribution, on-prem)

---

### PHASE 5: TYPE DEFINITIONS (TypeScript only)

Skip this phase for Python or Bash projects.

- [ ] Check `@types/*` coverage — for every untyped JS dependency, is there a corresponding `@types/` package?
- [ ] Version alignment — `@types/react` version should match `react` version range
- [ ] Inline types preferred — packages shipping their own `.d.ts` don't need `@types/`
- [ ] No `@types/` packages for dependencies that already include types (wasted install)

---

### PHASE 6: CONFIGURATION HEALTH

- [ ] Runtime version pinned: `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, or `engines` field in package.json
- [ ] Package manager version pinned: `packageManager` field in package.json, or `corepack enable`
- [ ] Security automation configured: `dependabot.yml` or `renovate.json` for auto-updates
- [ ] If dependabot/renovate exists: check it covers all package ecosystems (npm, pip, github-actions, docker)
- [ ] `.npmrc` settings appropriate (no `ignore-scripts=false`, proper registry)
- [ ] `overrides` / `resolutions` documented with reason (why is each override needed?)
- [ ] CI and release workflows install dependencies in a way consistent with the repo trust model
- [ ] Update automation is not silently auto-merging risky majors or security-sensitive changes without review
- [ ] If no automation exists, record the operational risk explicitly instead of merely noting absence

---

### PHASE 7: FIX

Apply fixes in priority order. Ask before each category using the runtime's structured question tool when available, or a concise plain-text question.

1. **Critical CVEs** — apply patch-level fixes for critical/high vulnerabilities
2. **Unused dependencies** — remove them (`npm uninstall` / `pip uninstall`)
3. **Misplaced dependencies** — move between deps ↔ devDeps
4. **Missing type definitions** — install `@types/*` for untyped packages
5. **Configuration gaps** — add `.nvmrc`, `engines`, etc.
6. **Patch/minor updates** — update safe packages (patch first, then minor)

**NEVER auto-upgrade major versions.** For major version upgrades, recommend `/404-sg-migrate` instead.
**NEVER weaken security controls** to make the dependency graph quieter. Do not disable audits, integrity controls, or scripts review as a shortcut.
If ambiguity affects a public flow, privileged action, tenant isolation, payment/auth path, or sensitive-data handling, ask a targeted clarification before making changes.

## Tracking (all modes)

Shared file write protocol for `AUDIT_LOG.md` and `TASKS.md`:
- First load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/operational-record-format.md`; new audit and task records must use that traffic-first operational format.
- Treat the snapshots loaded at skill start as informational only.
- Right before each write, re-read the target file from disk and use that version as authoritative.
- Append or replace only the intended row or subsection; never rewrite the whole file from stale context.
- If the expected anchor moved or changed, re-read once and recompute.
- If it is still ambiguous after the second read, stop and ask the user instead of forcing the write.

After generating the report and applying fixes:

### Log the audit

Create or update traffic-first audit operational records in the target audit logs:

1. **Project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/AUDIT_LOG.md`**: create or update a traffic-first `audit:` record for the Deps audit.
2. **Project-local `./AUDIT_LOG.md`**: same project-explicit traffic-first record; keep the required `[project]` token.

Create either file if missing with a short heading and traffic-first audit records per the shared operational record format.

### Update TASKS.md

1. **Local TASKS.md** (project root): create or update traffic-first task records for the Deps audit findings.
2. **Project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md`**: find the project section and mirror the same traffic-first task records.

---

## Important

- BuildFlowz (Bash/Shell) has no package manager — Deps = `—` in legacy compatibility `PROJECTS.md`. Skip it.
- SocialFlowz is empty — skip it.
- Never auto-upgrade major versions. Always recommend `/404-sg-migrate` for breaking changes.
- For monorepos (tubeflow), audit all workspace package.json files.
- For Python projects, check both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`.
- If `npm audit` / `pip-audit` is not available, install it first or use alternative tools.
- Do not conclude `dependencies are healthy` from quiet tooling alone. Distinguish `no known findings from available tools` from `supply-chain posture demonstrated sound`.
- If lockfile integrity, registry trust, CI install behavior, or runtime reachability could not be checked, record that explicitly as a proof gap.
