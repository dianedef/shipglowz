# 101-sg-ready Readiness Review Playbook

## Purpose

This reference holds the detailed readiness heuristics for `101-sg-ready`.
The top-level `SKILL.md` stays focused on the activation contract, while this
playbook carries the longer review checklist, report templates, and reviewer
rules that do not need to remain on the first screen.

## Structure Review

The spec must contain:

- `Title`
- `Status`
- `User Story`
- `Minimal Behavior Contract`
- `Success Behavior`
- `Error Behavior`
- `Problem`
- `Solution`
- `Scope In`
- `Scope Out`
- `Constraints`
- `Dependencies`
- `Invariants`
- `Links & Consequences`
- `Documentation Coherence`
- `Edge Cases`
- `Implementation Tasks`
- `Acceptance Criteria`
- `Test Contract`
- `Test Strategy`
- `Risks`
- `Execution Notes`
- `Open Questions`

If a required section is missing, the verdict is `not ready`.

## User-Story Alignment Review

Before looking at implementation detail, verify that the spec clearly links:

- the user problem
- the actor
- the trigger
- the expected behavior
- the business or operational value
- the explicit scope limits

Refuse the spec if a fresh reader cannot answer without hesitation:

- who wants what, and why?
- what does the feature accept or trigger?
- what does it produce or make observable?
- what happens when it fails?
- what does observable success look like?
- what does correctly handled failure look like?
- which major edge case must be covered?
- what changes concretely for the user or operator?
- what does not change?
- how will we know the user story is satisfied?

`Solution`, `Implementation Tasks`, and `Acceptance Criteria` must stay
traceable to the user story. A purely technical task with no explainable link to
the promised result is a readiness gap.

## Real Readiness Review

Check:

- frontmatter exists or an equivalent metadata convention is present
- `artifact: spec`, `metadata_schema_version`, `artifact_version`,
  `source_skill`, `created`, `updated`, `status`, `scope`, `risk_level`,
  `security_impact`, and `docs_impact` are filled
- `depends_on` lists the versions of business and technical docs used by the
  spec, or explicitly records `unknown` during migration
- no business or technical dependency used by the spec is known stale without
  explicit review
- the Documentation Freshness Gate is satisfied when the spec depends on a
  framework, SDK, service, API, auth, build, migration, or integration
  behavior
- if the spec requires manual proof, `Test Contract` includes `surface`,
  `proof_profile`, `proof_order`, `checklist_path` when applicable,
  `required_scenario_ids`, `required_results`, and an explicit
  `exception_with_proof` or `exception_without_proof`
- every required scenario is actionable and linked to implementation tasks
- `Status` is `draft` or `reviewed`, not already `ready` without verification
- no `TBD`, `TODO`, placeholder, or vague critical wording remains
- `Open Questions` is `None`
- the spec does not hide dependencies on conversation history
- it names important business preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
- `Minimal Behavior Contract` is a non-technical behavioral paragraph that
  covers trigger/input, result, failure, and a primary edge case
- `Success Behavior` and `Error Behavior` define observable behavior and proof
- successful actions produce an observable state change, or the spec justifies
  why success may stay silent and how it remains verifiable
- failing actions produce an observable explanation or recoverable state, or the
  spec justifies why failure may stay silent and how it remains recoverable
- `Execution Notes` gives an implementation approach, file-reading order,
  validation commands, stop conditions, and constraints such as packages,
  patterns, data flow, abstractions to avoid, and scope boundaries
- each task has a target file, explicit action, coherent dependency order, and a
  validation check
- `Links & Consequences` names upstream/downstream systems, consumers, and
  cross-validations
- `Documentation Coherence` names impacted docs or explicitly explains `None,
  because ...`
- acceptance criteria cover `Success Behavior`, `Error Behavior`, and edge cases
- UI/design specs name the project's canonical design-system contract or the
  prerequisite task that creates it
- data, auth, permission, feature flag, migration, and config prerequisites are
  explicit when relevant
- runtime diagnostics requirements are explicit, or a valid static exception is
  recorded
- operator autonomy is preserved: diagnostics, tests, verification, and proof
  say what to collect before asking the user
- `Scope Out` meaningfully bounds the work
- when the spec touches ShipGlowz artifacts, skills, reports, technical docs,
  prompts, or user-facing product copy, it respects ShipGlowz language doctrine

If a point materially changes behavior, scope, or security and is neither proven
by existing code nor resolved by the spec, the verdict is `not ready`.

## Adversarial Review

Run a real adversarial pass, not a cosmetic one.

Critique the spec as if you wanted to:

- provoke an implementation that is incorrect but plausible
- bypass the business flow
- force an inconsistent state
- exploit a hidden assumption
- break an adjacent system without detection

Questions to ask:

- could a fresh agent misread a requirement?
- does the minimal contract hide an assumption on input, output, failure, or an
  edge case?
- can `Success Behavior` be validated by a test, sanity check, log, or final
  observable state?
- does `Error Behavior` leave retries, rollbacks, timeouts, duplicates, or
  partial failures undefined?
- can success appear to do nothing?
- can failure disappear without a useful message, recoverable state, or action?
- would the planned approach choose the wrong package, abstraction, or data flow?
- is an important edge case missing?
- is a task ordered too early?
- is an action too vague to implement without another decision?
- could a linked system break without revalidation?
- is a cross-file or cross-surface consequence missing?
- would docs, FAQ, onboarding, pricing, screenshots, examples, or support copy
  become false after the change?
- can language doctrine confusion make the spec or related artifact easier to
  misread?
- does the test plan really let `103-sg-verify` judge compliance?
- does `Test Contract` distinguish required, optional, and exceptional proof?
- does the spec depend on recent external behavior without current official-doc
  proof?
- can the flow be bypassed by step skipping, replay, duplicate submission, stale
  state, or concurrent input?
- is there a false assumption that UI alone provides security?
- is there a false assumption that a local style patch is acceptable instead of a
  design-system source-of-truth change?
- does the spec assume honest actors, valid identifiers, clean external data, or
  a perfect event order?
- are non-nominal actors covered: no-rights user, malicious user, failing third
  party, admin, async job, legacy system?

If yes, the spec is not ready.

## Security Review

Perform a proportional security review guided at minimum by OWASP ASVS / Top 10
families and NIST SSDF habits.

For any spec touching auth, permissions, sensitive data, uploads, HTML/Markdown
rendering, APIs, webhooks, payments, admin, secrets, external integrations,
action execution, files, search, prompts, or automations, verify explicitly:

- Authentication: who can initiate the action and how identity is established
- Authorization: who can read, create, modify, delete, approve, or retry, and
  whether server-side controls are required
- Input validation: which inputs are untrusted and which bounds, formats,
  allowlists, or sanitization rules apply
- Workflow integrity: whether business steps can be bypassed, replayed, or
  injected into forbidden states
- Data exposure: which sensitive data exists and where it travels, stores, logs,
  caches, or exports
- Secrets and configuration: which tokens, keys, webhooks, env vars, machine
  permissions, or third-party accesses need protection
- External integrations: which trust assumptions exist on APIs, webhooks,
  incoming files, generated content, retrievers, or third-party services
- Logging and errors: what must be traced for audit/incident response and what
  must never be logged
- Availability and abuse: rate limits, quotas, size caps, spam/brute-force
  protection, loops, cost explosions, and uncontrolled fan-out
- Multi-tenant boundary: whether one tenant, user, org, or project can see or
  act on another's resources

Refuse the spec if a material security blind spot remains untreated.
For small local changes, require at least:

- `Security impact: none, because ...`
- or `Security impact: yes, mitigated by ...`

If security depends on an unresolved product decision, the spec stays
`not ready`.

## Reviewer Rules

- Do not implement from `101-sg-ready`.
- Be strict on blocking ambiguity.
- Prefer `not ready` over a weak approval.
- In user mode, translate gates into user consequences and avoid the full
  checklist when it does not change the decision.
- Reason against the user story, then do a "how does this break?" pass before
  concluding `ready`.
- Make the cyber-security risk level explicit.
- Check active docs, ShipGlowz language doctrine, design-system authority, and
  the Documentation Freshness Gate when their gate applies.
- If a missing question changes the contract or security, block instead of
  assuming.
- Give actionable corrections, not vague criticism.
- Refuse a spec that depends on future clarifications to be implemented cleanly.
- If a fresh context is needed for the next step and the skill cannot create it
  itself, ask the user to do so.
- Remain the canonical gate before the first implementation of non-trivial work.
