## Canonical Paths

Before resolving any ShipGlowz-owned file, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/canonical-paths.md` (`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT` defaults to `$HOME/shipglowz`). ShipGlowz tools, shared references, skill-local `references/*`, templates, workflow docs, and internal scripts must resolve from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT`, not from the project repo where the skill is running. Project artifacts and source files still resolve from the current project root unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Chantier Tracking

Trace category: `conditionnel`.
Process role: `source-de-chantier`.

Before producing the final report, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md` when this run is attached to a spec-first chantier. If exactly one active `specs/*.md` chantier is identified, append the current run to `Skill Run History`, update `Current Chantier Flow` when the run changes the chantier state, and include a final `Chantier` block. If no unique chantier is identified, do not write to any spec; report `Chantier: non applicable` or `Chantier: non trace` with the reason.

## Chantier Potential Intake

Because this skill has process role `source-de-chantier`, evaluate the standard threshold from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md` before the final report. If the findings reveal non-trivial future work and no unique chantier owns it, do not write to an existing spec; add a `Chantier potentiel` block with `oui`, `non`, or `incertain`, a proposed title, reason, severity, scope, evidence, recommended `/100-sg-spec ...` command, and next step. If the work is only a direct local fix or already belongs to the current chantier, state `Chantier potentiel: non` with the concrete reason.

## Mode detection

- `403-sg-perf` answers one specialist question:

```text
What performance risks are limiting this scope across bundle, rendering, loading, fetching, caching, or database behavior?
```

- **`$ARGUMENTS` is "global"** → GLOBAL MODE: performance audit across ALL projects.
- **`$ARGUMENTS` is a file path** → FILE MODE: deep performance review of that single file.
- **`$ARGUMENTS` is empty** → PROJECT MODE: full performance audit.

Keep the boundary explicit: stay in `403-sg-perf` when performance is already the dominant audit domain. Route back to `400-sg-audit` only when the operator needs multi-domain audit planning or consolidation beyond performance.

---

## GLOBAL MODE

Audit performance across ALL projects in the workspace.

1. Read `discovered project-local corpora (`shipglowz_data/` markers)` — check the **Domain Applicability** table. Identify projects with ✓ in the Perf column.

2. Use the runtime's structured question tool when available to let the user choose:
   - Question: "Which projects should I audit for performance?"
   - `multiSelect: true`
   - One option per applicable project: label = project name, description = stack inferred from project-local markers

3. Use available parallel agent/tooling to launch one bounded worker per **selected** project in a single parallel batch when supported. If unavailable, run the selected projects sequentially.

   Agent prompt must include:
   - `cd [path]` then read `CLAUDE.md` for project context
   - The absolute date, exact project path, and the perf context already surfaced by this skill (build config, framework detection, third-party scripts, assets)
   - The complete **PROJECT MODE** section from this skill (all 6 phases)
   - The **Tracking** section from this skill
   - Rule: before scoring, identify linked systems and performance consequences across bundle, rendering, fetching, caching, and third-party integrations
   - Rule: do not ask follow-up questions; if context is missing, state assumptions / confidence limits and continue
   - Required sub-report sections: `Scope understood`, `Context read`, `Linked systems & consequences`, `Findings`, `Confidence / missing context`

4. After all agents return, compile a **cross-project performance report**:

   ```
   GLOBAL PERFORMANCE AUDIT — [date]
   ═══════════════════════════════════════
   PROJECT SCORES
     [project]    [A/B/C/D]  —  summary
     ...
   CROSS-PROJECT PATTERNS
     [Shared perf issues: duplicate large deps, common anti-patterns]
   ALL ISSUES BY SEVERITY
     🔴 [project] file:line — description
     🟠 [project] file:line — description
     🟡 [project] file:line — description
   Total: X critical, Y high, Z medium across N projects
   ═══════════════════════════════════════
   ```

5. Update project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/AUDIT_LOG.md` (one traffic-first audit record per project, Perf column) and project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md` (each project's `### Audit: Perf` subsection).

6. Ask: **"Which projects should I fix?"** — list projects with scores. Fix only approved projects, one at a time.

---

## FILE MODE

### Step 1: Gather context

1. Read the target file (`$ARGUMENTS`).
2. Read files it imports/depends on (follow the imports, 1 level deep).
3. Identify the file's role: component, page, API route, utility, layout.

### Step 2: Audit the file

Score each category **A/B/C/D**.

#### 1. Bundle Impact
- [ ] No large dependencies imported for a small feature (e.g., lodash for one function)
- [ ] Imports use tree-shakeable paths (named imports, not full-library imports)
- [ ] Dynamic imports / lazy loading for heavy components
- [ ] No barrel file re-exports pulling in unused code

#### 2. Rendering Performance
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders (React: stable callbacks, proper deps arrays, memo where needed)
- [ ] No expensive computations on every render cycle
- [ ] CSS-in-JS not generating new class names on every render
- [ ] Conditional rendering for expensive subtrees
- [ ] Lists use proper keys (not index for dynamic lists)

#### 3. Data Fetching
- [ ] No waterfall requests (sequential when could be parallel)
- [ ] Data fetched at the right level (not too high, not too low)
- [ ] No over-fetching (requesting fields that aren't used)
- [ ] Proper loading/error states
- [ ] Caching or deduplication for repeated queries

#### 4. Memory & Cleanup
- [ ] Event listeners removed on unmount
- [ ] Intervals/timeouts cleared
- [ ] Subscriptions unsubscribed
- [ ] AbortController for fetch requests on unmount
- [ ] No closures capturing stale state

### Step 3: Fix

Fix issues rated B or worse. Explain each change.

### Step 4: Report

```

## PROJECT MODE

### Workspace root detection

If the current directory has no project markers (no `package.json`, no `requirements.txt`, no `src/` dir, no `lib.sh`) BUT contains multiple project subdirectories — you are at the **workspace root**, not inside a project.

Use the runtime's structured question tool when available, or a concise plain-text question:
- Question: "You're at the workspace root. Which project(s) should I audit for performance?"
- `multiSelect: true`
- Options:
  - **All projects** — "Run performance audit across every project" (Recommended)
  - One option per project from `discovered project-local corpora (`shipglowz_data/` markers)`: label = project name, description = stack

Then proceed to **GLOBAL MODE** with the selected projects.

### PHASE 1: BUNDLE & LOADING

Analyze the project's build output and dependency weight.

#### 1.1 Dependency Weight
- [ ] Identify top 10 largest dependencies by install size
- [ ] Flag oversized dependencies with lighter alternatives (moment→dayjs, lodash→lodash-es or native)
- [ ] Detect duplicate packages in the dependency tree (same package, different versions)
- [ ] Check for barrel exports (`index.ts`) re-exporting entire modules — bundle bloat

#### 1.2 Code Splitting
- [ ] Route-level code splitting configured
- [ ] Heavy components lazily loaded (`React.lazy`, `defineAsyncComponent`, dynamic imports)
- [ ] No single bundle containing rarely-used features
- [ ] Sentry browser tracing, profiling, replay, and source-map helpers are not bundled more broadly than needed

#### 1.3 Asset Optimization
- [ ] Images use modern formats (WebP/AVIF with fallbacks)
- [ ] Images have `srcset` / responsive sizing
- [ ] SVGs optimized (no unnecessary metadata)
- [ ] Fonts use WOFF2 format
- [ ] `font-display: swap` or `optional` configured
- [ ] Font subsetting applied (only needed character ranges)

#### 1.4 Script Loading
- [ ] Third-party scripts use `async` or `defer`
- [ ] Analytics/tracking/Sentry initialization does not block render
- [ ] No synchronous `<script>` tags in `<head>`
- [ ] Prefetch/preload for critical resources
- [ ] Sentry replay, tracing, and profiling sampling rates are proportionate to the environment and privacy/performance budget

---

### PHASE 2: RENDERING

#### 2.1 Rendering Strategy
- [ ] Static pages use SSG (not SSR or CSR)
- [ ] Dynamic pages use appropriate strategy (SSR for SEO, CSR for app-like)
- [ ] Client-side hydration is minimal (Astro islands, React Server Components)

#### 2.2 Client Hydration Analysis
- [ ] Components that could be server-only are not hydrated client-side
- [ ] `client:load` vs `client:visible` vs `client:idle` used appropriately (Astro)
- [ ] No full-page client hydration for mostly-static content

#### 2.3 Re-render Issues
- [ ] No parent re-renders cascading to all children unnecessarily
- [ ] Context providers scoped (not wrapping entire app for local state)
- [ ] Expensive renders behind React.memo / computed / memoization
- [ ] Event handlers are stable references (useCallback where needed)

#### 2.4 Virtualization
- [ ] Long lists (>50 items) use virtualization (react-window, @tanstack/virtual)
- [ ] Tables with many rows are virtualized
- [ ] Infinite scroll uses proper windowing

---

### PHASE 3: CORE WEB VITALS READINESS

#### 3.1 LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- [ ] Hero image/video has `fetchpriority="high"` and `loading="eager"`
- [ ] LCP element is in initial HTML (not injected by JS)
- [ ] No render-blocking CSS/JS delaying LCP
- [ ] Fonts preloaded if they affect LCP text
- [ ] `<Image>` component used with priority prop for above-fold images

#### 3.2 CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- [ ] Images and videos have explicit `width` and `height` attributes
- [ ] No FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text) — `font-display` configured
- [ ] No content injected above the fold after load (ads, banners, lazy content)
- [ ] Skeleton screens match actual content dimensions
- [ ] No layout-shifting animations

#### 3.3 INP (Interaction to Next Paint)
- [ ] Click/tap handlers respond under 200ms
- [ ] Heavy computations offloaded to Web Workers
- [ ] No long tasks blocking the main thread (>50ms)
- [ ] Input handlers debounced appropriately
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates for perceived speed
- [ ] Sentry instrumentation, breadcrumbs, and replay capture do not add avoidable long tasks to key interactions

#### 3.4 TTFB (Time to First Byte)
- [ ] Static pages served from CDN/edge
- [ ] SSR pages have efficient data fetching (no waterfalls)
- [ ] Database queries for page data are indexed
- [ ] Caching headers configured (Cache-Control, ETag)

---

### PHASE 4: DATA FETCHING

#### 4.1 Request Patterns
- [ ] No waterfall requests (use `Promise.all` or parallel loaders)
- [ ] No N+1 query patterns (fetching related data in loops)
- [ ] No over-fetching (GraphQL: use fragments; REST: use sparse fieldsets or dedicated endpoints)
- [ ] Request deduplication for same data needed in multiple components

#### 4.2 Caching Strategy
- [ ] API responses cached appropriately (SWR, React Query, Convex reactive queries)
- [ ] Stale-while-revalidate pattern for non-critical data
- [ ] Cache invalidation on mutations
- [ ] Static data pre-fetched at build time where possible

#### 4.3 Optimistic Updates
- [ ] Write operations update UI immediately (don't wait for server response)
- [ ] Rollback on failure with user feedback
- [ ] Convex: use optimistic updates for mutations

#### 4.4 Prefetching
- [ ] Next page data prefetched on link hover/focus
- [ ] Critical API calls initiated early (not waiting for component mount)
- [ ] Route prefetching configured for likely next pages

---

### PHASE 5: DATABASE & BACKEND

#### 5.1 Query Optimization
- [ ] Indexes defined for common query patterns
- [ ] No full table scans for filtered queries
- [ ] Compound indexes for multi-field queries
- [ ] Convex: indexes defined in `schema.ts` for all `withIndex` queries

#### 5.2 Unbounded Queries
- [ ] All list queries have limits (`.take(n)` / `LIMIT`)
- [ ] Pagination implemented for large datasets
- [ ] No `SELECT *` or equivalent fetching all fields
- [ ] Cursor-based pagination for large datasets (not offset)

#### 5.3 Connection & Resource Management
- [ ] Connection pooling configured for database
- [ ] No connection leaks (connections always returned to pool)
- [ ] Timeouts configured for external API calls
- [ ] Rate limiting respected for third-party APIs

#### 5.4 Caching Layer
- [ ] Frequently accessed data cached (in-memory, Redis, or CDN)
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategy defined
- [ ] Cache TTL appropriate for data freshness requirements
- [ ] No stale cache served for critical data (auth, payments)

---

### PHASE 6: FIX + REPORT

#### Fix Priority
1. **Critical** — N+1 queries, missing indexes, unbounded queries, memory leaks
2. **High** — Missing code splitting, no image optimization, waterfall requests
3. **Medium** — Missing lazy loading, suboptimal caching, minor CWV issues
4. **Low** — Prefetching, optimistic updates, minor bundle size improvements

## Stack-specific notes

Apply the relevant section based on detected framework:

**Astro**: Focus on islands pattern — verify `client:*` directives are minimal. Static pages should have zero JS. Check `astro:assets` Image component usage. View Transitions API perf impact.

**Next.js**: Check RSC (React Server Components) boundaries — `"use client"` only where needed. Streaming SSR for slow data. `next/image` with `priority` for above-fold. `next/font` for zero-layout-shift fonts.

**React Native / Expo**: List virtualization (FlatList vs FlashList). Image caching (expo-image). Bundle size with `npx expo-doctor`. Hermes engine optimizations. Avoid inline styles in render loops.

**Python (FastAPI)**: Async I/O for all external calls. Connection pooling (SQLAlchemy async). Background tasks for heavy operations. Response model filtering (don't return full ORM objects).

**Bash/Shell**: Script execution time. Subshell avoidance where possible. Caching of expensive operations (BuildFlowz 5s TTL pattern). Avoid repeated file reads in loops.

---

## Tracking (all modes)

Shared file write protocol for `AUDIT_LOG.md` and `TASKS.md`:
- First load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/operational-record-format.md`; new audit and task records must use that traffic-first operational format.
- Treat the snapshots loaded at skill start as informational only.
- Right before each write, re-read the target file from disk and use that version as authoritative.
- Append or replace only the intended row or subsection; never rewrite the whole file from stale context.
- If the expected anchor moved or changed, re-read once and recompute.
- If it is still ambiguous after the second read, stop and ask the user instead of forcing the write.

After generating the report and applying fixes:

### Log the audit

Create or update traffic-first audit operational records in the target audit logs:

1. **Project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/AUDIT_LOG.md`**: create or update a traffic-first `audit:` record for the Perf audit.
2. **Project-local `./AUDIT_LOG.md`**: same project-explicit traffic-first record; keep the required `[project]` token.

Create either file if missing with a short heading and traffic-first audit records per the shared operational record format.

### Update TASKS.md

1. **Local TASKS.md** (project root): create or update traffic-first task records for the Perf audit findings.
2. **Project-local `shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md`**: create or update the same traffic-first task records.

## Important

- audit-seo keeps its own SEO-specific performance checks (render-blocking resources, LCP for SEO ranking). This skill does **deep** performance analysis.
- Be specific about file paths and line numbers for every issue.
- Detect the stack automatically. Only audit relevant sections (e.g., skip CWV for React Native).
- For Bash/Shell projects, focus on script efficiency and caching patterns.
- Performance issues are never optional — a slow site is a broken site.
