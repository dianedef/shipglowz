## Canonical Paths

Before resolving any ShipGlowz-owned file, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/canonical-paths.md` (`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT` defaults to `$HOME/shipglowz`). ShipGlowz tools, shared references, skill-local `references/*`, templates, workflow docs, and internal scripts must resolve from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT`, not from the project repo where the skill is running. Project artifacts and source files still resolve from the current project root unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Chantier Tracking

Trace category: `conditionnel`.
Process role: `source-de-chantier`.

Before producing the final report, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md` when this run is attached to a spec-first chantier. If exactly one active chantier spec is identified, append the current run to `Skill Run History`, update `Current Chantier Flow` when the run changes chantier state, and include a final `Chantier` block. If no unique chantier is identified, do not write to any spec; report `Chantier: non applicable` or `Chantier: non trace` with the reason.

Because this skill can expose data-loss, tenant-boundary, privacy, and security work, evaluate whether non-trivial follow-up needs `/100-sg-spec` before implementation.

## Report Modes

Before producing the final report, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/reporting-contract.md`.

Default to `report=user`: concise, outcome-first, and in the user's active language. Use `report=agent`, `handoff`, `verbose`, or `full-report` when another skill needs the full Sync Contract, data-domain matrix, validation commands, unresolved policy decisions, or proof gaps.

## Required References

Load only the references required by the active run:

- `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/decision-quality-contract.md` before choosing defaults, route, proof, or implementation scope.
- `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/spec-driven-development-discipline.md` before changing behavior, defining proof, or recommending implementation.
- `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/master-workflow-lifecycle.md` before routing non-trivial sync implementation through lifecycle gates.
- `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/question-contract.md` before asking user-facing decisions.
- `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/documentation-freshness-gate.md` when provider, SDK, auth, storage, offline, encryption, or platform behavior affects the sync design.
- `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/winflowz-suite-product-registry.md` when WinFlowz suite free products, account-backed sync eligibility, or product access preconditions are mentioned.
- `references/local-cloud-sync-doctrine.md` for account promotion, merge, conflict, tombstone, and queue doctrine.
- `references/ux-security-checklist.md` for user-visible state, sensitive-data policy, tenant/account boundaries, logging, and abuse controls.
- `references/sync-guidance-overlay-and-merge-pattern.md` when designing, auditing, or implementing a SocialGlowz-style real-time sync guidance overlay with post-auth hydration, local/cloud merge decisions, durable queue, and ready feedback.
- `references/flutter-implementation-checklist.md` when the target project uses Flutter, Riverpod, Firebase, secure storage, local stores, or mobile/web proof surfaces.

## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Current date: !`date '+%Y-%m-%d'`
- Project name: !`basename $(pwd)`
- Git branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`
- Git status: !`git status --short 2>/dev/null || echo "not a git repo"`
- Project docs: !`ls shipglowz_data/technical/architecture.md shipglowz_data/technical/guidelines.md shipglowz_data/business/product.md shipglowz_data/business/business.md README.md CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "no project docs found"`
- Available specs: !`find shipglowz_data/workflow/specs specs docs -maxdepth 3 -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | sort | head -80`

## Mission

`600-sg-local-cloud-sync` is the ShipGlowz entrypoint for local-first data becoming account-backed cloud data.

It turns a project, feature, data domain, or sync question into a practical Sync Contract:

```text
local data inventory
  -> auth/account association
  -> cloud snapshot and ownership boundary
  -> promotion, hydration, merge, conflict, and tombstone policy
  -> sync/save UX states and retry behavior
  -> sensitive-data and secrets policy
  -> offline queue and durability requirements
  -> proof ladder and docs impact
  -> spec/build/verify routing when implementation is needed
```

This skill complements `001-sg-build`, `008-sg-customer`, and `601-sg-product-entitlements`. `001-sg-build` owns implementation lifecycle. `008-sg-customer` owns broad activation and setup comprehension. `601-sg-product-entitlements` owns product access/entitlement preconditions. `600-sg-local-cloud-sync` owns the data-trust contract: no local wipe on account creation, no cross-account replay, no vague merge policy, no hidden secret sync, and no reinstall-recovery promise without durable proof.

## Mode Detection

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as a sync target.

| Intent | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Read-only sync architecture advice for a clear project | Produce a Sync Contract in the final report |
| Audit an existing local/cloud sync plan or implementation | Review against the doctrine and report findings plus chantier potential |
| Real-time sync guidance widget, post-auth sync overlay, or SocialGlowz-style local/cloud merge UX | Load the Sync Guidance Overlay And Merge Pattern reference, then produce or route the implementation contract |
| Non-trivial implementation across data stores, auth, cloud, UI, docs, or tests | Route to `100-sg-spec -> 101-sg-ready -> 001-sg-build/102-sg-start` |
| Access control, entitlement gating, or entitlement precondition ambiguity | Route access decisions to `601-sg-product-entitlements` before final sync contract |
| Existing ready spec already owns the sync work | Attach to that spec and support the active lifecycle |
| User activation, tutorials, or setup copy dominates | Route or hand off to `008-sg-customer` after the sync contract is clear |
| Provider behavior, SDK semantics, encryption, or offline storage rules are current/external | Run the Documentation Freshness Gate before design decisions |
| Data domains, account boundaries, or secret policy are unclear | Ask one targeted decision question or block |

When two routes are materially plausible, load `question-contract.md` and ask one concise numbered decision question. Otherwise choose the context-safe default that best preserves data integrity, privacy, security, and proof quality.

## Sync Contract

For read-only, audit, or spec-intake output, produce this compact structure:

```text
Sync Contract: [project/feature]

Data domains:
Local durability:
Remote authority:
Account association:
Promotion trigger:
Hydration trigger:
Merge policy:
Conflict policy:
Delete/tombstone policy:
Offline queue:
Sensitive-data policy:
Secrets policy:
Sync/save UX states:
Retry/recovery:
Tenant/account boundary:
Observability:
Proof path:
Docs/editorial impact:
Implementation route:
```

If implementation is needed, convert the contract into a spec-ready behavior contract instead of editing source files directly.

## Core Doctrine

Every sync recommendation or implementation contract must cover:

- **No silent local wipe**: account creation or sign-in must not discard anonymous/local user data.
- **Account association**: local data needs remembered account metadata before it can be replayed automatically into cloud.
- **Empty-cloud distinction**: an empty cloud snapshot after sign-up is not the same as an empty cloud snapshot after signing into an existing account.
- **Cloud hydration**: a clean local install with existing cloud data should hydrate local state after auth and entitlement checks.
- **Domain keys**: every sync domain needs stable business keys and deterministic identity.
- **Merge matrix**: equal checksums sync cleanly; disjoint keys merge; same key/different payload conflicts unless reliable latest-wins metadata exists.
- **Latest-wins constraints**: latest modification can win only when timestamps, device/source IDs, and clock assumptions are reliable enough for the domain risk.
- **Tombstones**: delete-capable domains need tombstones, retention, or another explicit delete propagation model.
- **Offline queue**: local changes made while offline or unauthenticated need durable pending state or a declared local-only exception.
- **Secrets excluded by default**: secrets, tokens, credentials, private keys, and recovery material are not synced unless a future spec explicitly designs secure secret sync.
- **Visible states**: sync and settings-save state should show loading, saved/synced, pending, retrying, blocked, and error states when relevant.
- **Proof before promise**: reinstall/relogin recovery must not be claimed until durable remote write and hydration are proven.
- **Access gating**: unresolved or inactive entitlement state is not a sync boundary pass; treat as denied until entitlement ownership is explicit.
- **WinFlowz suite free access**: when WinFlowz sync depends on product access, load the suite product registry before interpreting local-only, inactive-access, or free-account states.

## Security And Privacy Rules

For auth, tenant, data, and sensitive-content surfaces:

- identify who can initiate promotion, hydration, merge, delete, retry, export, or import
- enforce ownership server-side or provider-side when remote data is touched
- block cross-account replay unless an explicit import/export flow is designed
- validate untrusted remote and local payloads before merge
- avoid logging secrets, tokens, credentials, PII, full clipboard contents, private payloads, or raw sync snapshots
- treat sync UI as feedback only, never as the security boundary
- document retention for tombstones, deleted records, and queued operations
- consider abuse risks: repeated promotion attempts, huge payloads, expensive fan-out, replay, duplicate writes, and quota exhaustion
- name the provider trust assumptions and use fresh official docs when provider behavior controls correctness

## Proof Paths

Choose proof proportional to the surface:

- `scenario-first`: default for sync contracts and skill-level routing.
- `test-first`: for pure controller, merge, conflict, tombstone, metadata, queue, and adapter logic.
- `regression-first`: for data-loss or cross-account replay bugs.
- `evidence-first`: for UI sync-state proof, hosted/browser smoke, provider console evidence, logs, or docs.
- `exception-with-proof`: only when a proof surface is unavailable; name the alternate evidence.

Default proof ladder:

1. Pure domain/controller tests for merge, conflict, metadata, account association, and tombstones.
2. Store/adapter tests for durable local snapshots and remote write/read contracts.
3. UI/widget tests for sync/save indicators, retry, blocked, and error states.
4. Browser/auth proof for shared web UI when available.
5. Provider/integration proof for real backend boundaries.
6. Device/manual proof only for native-only storage, OS permissions, lifecycle, offline behavior, or reinstall/relogin paths.

## Documentation And Editorial Gates

After sync work, produce both statuses:

- `Documentation Update Plan`: `complete` / `no impact` / `blocked`
- `Editorial Update Plan`: `complete` / `no editorial impact` / `blocked`

Check impact on:

- architecture docs, data model docs, security/privacy docs, support docs, onboarding docs, manual QA checklists, changelog, release notes, public claims, pricing/plan copy, and screenshots
- in-app wording around backup, sync, saved, cloud, account, export, import, and reinstall recovery
- support promises about account creation preserving local data

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report `blocked` or route to the owner skill when:

- implementation would change behavior without a ready spec
- local data durability is insufficient for the promised sync behavior
- auth identity, tenant boundary, entitlement, or account association is unclear
- merge keys or conflict policy are undefined
- latest-wins is proposed without reliable metadata
- deletes exist without tombstones or retention policy
- secrets or sensitive content would be synced by convenience
- cross-account replay could occur
- provider behavior matters and fresh official docs are missing
- sync scope that depends on entitlements is blocked until access preconditions are explicit
- UI claims saved/synced before durable local and remote success criteria are met
- reinstall/relogin recovery is promised without full write/hydrate proof
- unrelated dirty files would enter implementation or ship scope

## Validation

For skill-contract changes, validate with:

```bash
rg -n "name: 600-sg-local-cloud-sync|Sync Contract|Core Doctrine|Security And Privacy Rules|Proof Paths|Stop Conditions" skills/600-sg-local-cloud-sync/SKILL.md
rg -n "account association|cross-account|secrets|tombstones|latest-wins|reinstall|Flutter|Riverpod" skills/600-sg-local-cloud-sync/references
test -f skills/600-sg-local-cloud-sync/references/sync-guidance-overlay-and-merge-pattern.md
python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown
tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh --check --skill 600-sg-local-cloud-sync
```

For product implementations, use the project checks named by the ready spec and route browser/auth/manual/provider proof to the proper owner skill.

Agent/handoff mode may include the full Sync Contract, data-domain matrix, owner-skill routing, target files, validation commands, unresolved decisions, and proof gaps.

## Rules

- Do not treat sync as a storage toggle.
- Do not duplicate `001-sg-build`, `100-sg-spec`, `101-sg-ready`, `103-sg-verify`, `300-sg-docs`, `008-sg-customer`, `107-sg-test`, `108-sg-browser`, or `109-sg-auth-debug` internals.
- Keep internal contracts in English and user-facing output in the active user language.
- Ask only when the answer changes data ownership, account boundary, security posture, conflict policy, sensitive-data policy, proof, docs/public claims, or implementation scope.
- Prefer a blocked sync contract over a convenient data-loss path.
