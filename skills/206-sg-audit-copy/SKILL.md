## Canonical Paths

Before resolving any ShipGlowz-owned file, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/canonical-paths.md` (`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT` defaults to `$HOME/shipglowz`). ShipGlowz tools, shared references, skill-local `references/*`, templates, workflow docs, and internal scripts must resolve from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT`, not from the project repo where the skill is running. Project artifacts and source files still resolve from the current project root unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Instruction Layering

This `SKILL.md` is the activation contract. Before editing or expanding this skill, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/skill-instruction-layering.md` and keep bulky workflow detail in skill-local references.

## Chantier Tracking

Trace category: `conditionnel`.
Process role: `source-de-chantier`.

Before producing the final report, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md`. If attached to one unique chantier spec, write the run trace there. If no unique chantier exists, do not write to a spec.

## Chantier Potential Intake

Because this skill has process role `source-de-chantier`, evaluate the standard threshold from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md` before the final report. Add a `Chantier potentiel` block when findings reveal non-trivial future work and no unique chantier owns it.

## Report Modes

Before producing the final report, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/reporting-contract.md`.

Default to `report=user`: concise, findings-first for audits and failures, outcome-first for successful support runs, and in the user's active language. Use `report=agent`, `handoff`, `verbose`, or `full-report` only when detailed evidence is needed.

## Required References

Always load shared references only when their gate applies. Load skill-local references precisely by mode:

- `references/copy-audit-workflow.md`: Copy audit modes, business/brand context checks, page/project checklists, rewrite rules, scoring, and reporting details.
- `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/content-quality-rubric.md`: shared rubric for comparable score and feedback structuré across content owner skills.
- `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/task-registry-routing.md`: choose `workflow/TASKS.md` versus `editorial/ROADMAP.md` before durable follow-up writes.

## Mode Detection

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` and choose the smallest safe mode under `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/decision-quality-contract.md`: bounded professional scope, never shortcut quality.

- GLOBAL MODE: load `references/copy-audit-workflow.md` for project-wide voice, hierarchy, and conversion copy review.
- PAGE MODE: load the workflow reference and audit or rewrite the named page or copy file.
- PROJECT MODE: load the workflow reference before broad copy inventory, page scans, and fix planning.

## Core Execution Rules

- Preserve claim evidence, business/brand fit, trust, clarity, friction, conversion, and documentation corpus gates.
- When the surface mentions declared products, add product-inventory and proof-backed-claim coherence to the copy review instead of treating it as decorative wording.
- For rubric-driven audits, use `content-quality-rubric.md` as the only scoring contract and return structured feedback with explicit `needs revision` or `blocked` when applicable.
- Evaluate `Chantier potentiel` for multi-page conversion, legal, trust, or positioning work.
- Do not invent proof, guarantees, pricing, testimonials, customer facts, or legal claims.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report blocked when:

- A required reference is missing or contradicts this activation contract.
- The requested work would change behavior outside this skill's scope.
- A safety, security, documentation, source, claim, auth, production, redaction, or chantier guardrail would need to be weakened.
- The action would edit unrelated dirty files or mutate durable state without an owner-skill contract.

## Validation

Validate this skill after edits with:

- `rg -n "Trace category|Process role|Chantier Potential|Report Modes|claim|conversion|trust|references/" skills/206-sg-audit-copy/SKILL.md`
- `python3 tools/skill_budget_audit.py --skills-root skills --format markdown`
- `tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh --check --all`
