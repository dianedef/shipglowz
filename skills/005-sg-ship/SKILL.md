description: "Ship with checks, commits, pushes, and closure when needed."
argument-hint: [optional: commit message | "end la tache" for full close | skip-check | all-dirty]
---

Primary artifact type: `specialist-workflow`.

## Canonical Paths

Before resolving any ShipGlowz-owned file, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/canonical-paths.md` (`$SHIPFLOW_ROOT` defaults to `$HOME/shipglowz`). ShipGlowz tools, shared references, skill-local `references/*`, templates, workflow docs, and internal scripts must resolve from `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT`, not from the project repo where the skill is running. Project artifacts and source files still resolve from the current project root unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Instruction Layering

This `SKILL.md` is the activation contract. Keep shipping-mode semantics, bug-risk rules, and report framing here; do not let quick-ship convenience absorb lifecycle proof or closure doctrine owned elsewhere.

## Chantier Tracking

Trace category: `obligatoire`.
Process role: `lifecycle`.

Before shipping a spec-first chantier, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/chantier-tracking.md`, then read the spec's `Skill Run History` and `Current Chantier Flow` when a unique spec exists. Append a current `005-sg-ship` row with result `shipped`, `not shipped`, `blocked`, or `skipped checks`, update `Current Chantier Flow`, and end the report with a compact `Chantier` block. If quick ship is not attached to one unique chantier spec, do not write to a spec; report `Chantier: non applicable` or `Chantier: non trace` with the reason.

## Report Modes

Before producing the final report, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/reporting-contract.md`.

Default to `report=user`: concise, outcome-first, and using the compact chantier block. Use `report=agent`, `handoff`, `verbose`, or `full-report` only when explicitly requested or when another agent needs detailed ship evidence.

## ShipGlowz-Owned Preflight

Apply `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/shipglowz-owned-preflight.md` before reading ShipGlowz-owned references, running ShipGlowz-owned tools/scripts, or checking ShipGlowz-owned ship/runtime surfaces.

## Required References

Before full-close mode, or any ship report that could imply formal closure, load `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/closure-archive-guard.md`.

## Mission

`005-sg-ship` owns git shipping: checks, staging, commit, push, and the post-push route when applicable. It is not the owner of implementation completeness (`102-sg-start`), proof completeness (`103-sg-verify`), or closure bookkeeping (`104-sg-end`) unless full-close mode is explicitly requested.

`005-sg-ship` answers one question:

```text
What git state should be shipped now, and with what explicit limits?
```

If closure bookkeeping is still the next unresolved owner, stay with `104-sg-end` instead of using quick ship as a closure substitute.

## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Current date: !`date '+%Y-%m-%d'`
- Git status: !`git status --short 2>/dev/null || echo "Not a git repo"`
- Git diff stat: !`git diff HEAD --stat 2>/dev/null || echo ""`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`
- ShipGlowz development mode: !`rg -n "ShipGlowz Development Mode|development_mode|validation_surface|ship_before_preview_test|post_ship_verification|deployment_provider" CLAUDE.md SHIPFLOW.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No project development mode documented"`
- Recent commits (style reference): !`git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null || echo "no commits"`
- Project-local TASKS.md: !`cat shipglowz_data/workflow/TASKS.md 2>/dev/null || cat TASKS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No TASKS.md"`
- Existing CHANGELOG: !`head -20 CHANGELOG.md 2>/dev/null || echo "no CHANGELOG.md"`

## Your task

`005-sg-ship` has two modes.

Before choosing mode, read `${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-$HOME/shipglowz}/skills/references/project-development-mode.md` and inspect the project-local `## ShipGlowz Development Mode` section in `CLAUDE.md` or `SHIPFLOW.md`. This does not change quick vs full shipping, but it changes the required next action after a successful push.

### Mode 1 — Quick ship (default)

Default behavior when `$ARGUMENTS` does NOT include end-of-task keywords:
- `end la tache`
- `end`
- `fin`
- `close task`

Quick mode is optimized for fast iteration:
1. Optional lightweight checks (skip if `skip-check` is present)
2. Stage
3. Commit
4. Push
5. One short report

Do NOT update TASKS.md or CHANGELOG.md in quick mode.
Do NOT claim the work is product-complete, user-story-complete, or security-validated just because it was committed and pushed.

By default, stage only changes that are clearly part of the current task/session or intentionally selected for this ship. If `$ARGUMENTS` includes `all-dirty`, ship the entire dirty Git state in the selected repo, including files not touched during the current conversation.

### Mode 2 — Full close + ship (explicit)

Only when `$ARGUMENTS` includes one of the end-of-task keywords above:
1. Summarize session
2. Update TASKS.md (master + local)
3. Update CHANGELOG.md
4. Save decisions to memory
5. Run checks (unless `skip-check`)
6. Stage, commit, push
7. One full closing report

Use this mode when the task is truly finished and should be formally closed.
Even in full mode, bookkeeping and git operations are not proof that the shipped change is functionally complete, safe, or production-ready.

---

## Step 1 — Workspace root detection

If the current directory has no `.git` directory BUT contains project subdirectories with changes, use the runtime's structured question tool when available, or a concise plain-text question:
- "Which project should I ship?"
- One option per project with uncommitted changes
- `multiSelect: false`

Then work inside that project for all remaining steps.

## Step 2 — Decide mode

Inspect `$ARGUMENTS`:
- if it contains `end la tache`, `end`, `fin`, or `close task` -> `full`
- otherwise -> `quick`

Also inspect `$ARGUMENTS` for staging scope:
- if it contains `all-dirty`, `ship-all`, or `tout-dirty` -> stage every tracked, modified, deleted, and untracked file in the selected repo after the secret check
- otherwise -> stage only the current task/session changes or ask if the staging scope is ambiguous

## Step 2.5 — Clarify shipping intent when ambiguous

If the current context suggests uncertainty about whether the work is actually ready to ship, ask a concise user question before staging. Ask only when the answer changes the closure level, release framing, or safety posture.

Typical triggers:
- the work looks partial, exploratory, or intentionally unverified
- changed files touch auth, permissions, payments, billing, secrets, tenant boundaries, destructive actions, webhooks, background jobs, migrations, or public flows
- changed files alter user-facing feature behavior while docs, README, guides, FAQ, onboarding, examples, pricing, changelog or support copy may still describe the old behavior
- checks are skipped or materially incomplete for the kind of change made
- the requested wording implies "done", "ready", or "safe" but the evidence does not support that claim

Examples:
- "Do you want a quick push for collaboration, or do you want this treated as formally closed?"
- "This touches auth/data/public flow. Should I ship with an explicit partial-risk note, or stop for clarification first?"
- "Checks are partial. Do you want a commit/push anyway, with the report stating validation is incomplete?"

## Step 3 — Safety checks before staging

Check for secrets:
- if untracked `.env`, credential, or token files are not ignored, stop and warn
- when using `all-dirty`, inspect the complete dirty file list before staging and explicitly exclude nothing unless it is a secret/safety issue; if a secret/safety issue is present, stop instead of partially staging

## Step 3.5 — Pre-ship bug risk gate (`bugs/` + optional `BUGS.md`)

Run a lightweight bug gate in both `quick` and `full` mode before checks/staging:
- read `bugs/*.md` as the source of truth for known bug work items
- read `BUGS.md` only as optional triage context when present
- when a linked high-impact bug is found, open corresponding `bugs/BUG-ID.md` for confirmation
- keep this check fast; do not run a heavy audit in quick mode

Classify bug risk outcome for the ship report:
- `blocked`: at least one linked `high` or `critical` bug is still open (`open`, `needs-info`, `needs-repro`, `in-diagnosis`, `fix-attempted`)
- `partial-risk`: linked bug exists in uncertain intermediate state (for example `fixed-pending-verify`) or scope linkage is partial
- `not assessed`: no usable bug files or scope too ambiguous for a safe claim

Rules:
- do not claim closure when bug risk is `blocked` or `partial-risk`
- for `blocked`, stop before commit unless user explicitly asks to proceed with a risk note
- quick mode must still report honest bug status, even when checks are skipped

## Step 4 — Pre-checks

If mode is `quick`:
- run lightweight checks only when practical
- skip all checks when `$ARGUMENTS` includes `skip-check`

If mode is `full`:
- run normal checks (unless `skip-check`)

Checks policy:
- if `package.json` exists: run typecheck and lint scripts if present
- do NOT run full build here by default
- if `test_*.sh` exists and shell files changed: run `bash -n` on touched shell files

Validation doctrine:
- tailor the report to the evidence actually gathered; do not imply more confidence than the checks support
- explicitly call out missing proof for user-story completion, product coherence, and security-sensitive behavior when relevant
- explicitly call out missing documentation alignment when feature behavior changed and docs were not checked
- if the change is high-risk and no meaningful validation is available, pause and ask the user instead of silently shipping under a misleading "ready" framing

If a check fails:
- stop and report failure
- suggest rerun with `skip-check` if user wants to force ship

## Step 5 — Full-mode bookkeeping (only in full mode)

Only for mode `full`:
- apply `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/skills/references/closure-archive-guard.md` before done/closed/changelog wording
- update the project-local tracker when relevant
- update CHANGELOG.md with meaningful grouped entries
- save useful decisions to memory
- summarize work in terms of the user story or user-facing outcome when that can be inferred from the task
- summarize documentation alignment: updated, not impacted, or remaining gap
- if closure status is still ambiguous, prefer partial/in-progress wording in TASKS or ask the user rather than forcing `done`
- treat the TASKS snapshots loaded at skill start as informational only
- right before editing any TASKS file, re-read it from disk and use that version as authoritative
- apply a minimal targeted edit to the relevant rows only; never rewrite the whole file from stale context
- if the expected row or section moved, re-read once and recompute; if it is still ambiguous, stop and ask the user

Skip this step entirely in quick mode.

## Step 6 — Stage and commit

Stage and commit.

If `$ARGUMENTS` includes `all-dirty`, `ship-all`, or `tout-dirty`, stage the entire dirty repo:
```bash
git add -A
```

Otherwise, stage only the files that belong to the current task/session, using explicit paths:
```bash
git add -- path/to/file path/to/other-file
```

When shipping changes that create, rename, or materially update `skills/*/SKILL.md`, include a pre-commit runtime visibility check in the practical check set:
```bash
${SHIPFLOW_ROOT:-$HOME/shipglowz}/tools/shipglowz_sync_skills.sh --check --skill <name>
```
Use `--check --all` for broad skill visibility drift. Do not duplicate symlink repair logic in `005-sg-ship`; route repair to the shared helper or back to the owning lifecycle skill.

Then commit:
```bash
git commit -m "[message from $ARGUMENTS or derived summary]
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

Use a HEREDOC for commit message.

## Step 7 — Push

```bash
git push
# if no upstream: git push -u origin <branch>
```

## Step 7.5 — Post-push deployment handoff

If the push succeeds and the project development mode is `vercel-preview-push`, the immediate next action is:

```bash
/405-sg-prod [project name or deployment URL if known]
```

If the project development mode is `hybrid`, require the same `/405-sg-prod` handoff when the shipped change needs hosted validation: auth/OAuth, callbacks, webhooks, Vercel routing, edge/serverless runtime, deployment env vars, or preview/prod-only data behavior.

Do not tell the user to run manual/browser tests before `405-sg-prod` has confirmed the matching deployment is ready. In the report, state that the push is complete but preview validation is still pending behind `405-sg-prod`.

## Step 8 — One report

Report formatting rules:
- Match the user's active language for report labels and explanations. Keep commands, file paths, commit hashes, branch names, and stable status values literal.
- Use a few status emojis in user reports when they help scanning: `🚀` for pushed/shipped, `✅` for passed checks, `⚠️` for limits or risk, `📝` for docs/bookkeeping, and `🎯` for final lifecycle completion. Do not decorate every line.
- Structure user-mode ship reports as outcome first, evidence second, limits last.
- Combine push, repo state, checks, and full-mode bookkeeping into one concise status line when possible: `🚀 Pushed to origin/main. Repo clean. ✅ Checks passed. 📝 Tasks/Changelog updated.`
- Use `All checks passed ✅` when every required or attempted check passed.
- Use `✅ Checks passed: [short list]` when naming the actual checks is clearer than a generic success line.
- Use `All checks passed except: [check], [check]` only when shipping continues despite explicitly accepted or non-blocking check gaps.
- Use `Checks skipped: [reason]` when checks are intentionally skipped.
- If push fails, replace the status line with `Push failed: [reason]. Repo [state]. [check summary].`
- Prefer a compact `Limits:` / `Limites:` line for partial proof, missing bug gate, unknown development mode, or remaining validation instead of scattering raw internal gate labels through the report.
- In the `Chantier` block, put the spec path directly under the heading; do not prefix it with `Chantier:`.
- Use one compact `Flux:` line with status markers, for example `Flux: 100-sg-spec ✅ -> 101-sg-ready ✅ -> 102-sg-start ✅ -> 103-sg-verify ✅ -> 104-sg-end ✅ -> 005-sg-ship ✅🎯`.
- Omit `Trace spec`, `Verdict 005-sg-ship`, `Reste a faire`, and `Prochaine etape` when they are redundant or empty.
- Include `Reste a faire:` only when a concrete remaining item exists.
- Include `Prochaine etape:` only when a real next command/action exists, especially required `/405-sg-prod` preview validation.

## Rules

- Quick mode is the default
- Full close flow requires explicit end-of-task keyword
- Use `all-dirty` only when the user explicitly asks to ship all dirty files, all repo changes, unrelated changes, or changes not made in the current conversation
- Do NOT force push to main/master
- Do NOT commit secrets
- If nothing to commit, say so clearly
- Keep report concise
- Do not equate commit/push, green checks, or updated tracking files with proof that the product is done or secure
- Do not use full-close wording when source-of-truth deltas, docs, bug state, or proof gaps remain unsynced and unrouted.
- Prefer honest "shipped for iteration" wording over overstated "done" wording when validation is partial
- Prefer honest "docs not checked" wording over implying feature docs are aligned
- If the change may affect public behavior or safety posture and the status is unclear, ask before shipping
- If linked bug status is `blocked`, `partial-risk`, or `not assessed`, say it explicitly in the report.
- If project mode is `vercel-preview-push`, never make `/107-sg-test` the next step before `/405-sg-prod`.
