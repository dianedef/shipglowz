# ShipFlow Changelog

## [2026-07-18]

### Changed
- Unfinished chantier reports now end with plain-language choices to continue, reprioritize, or pause; internal skills, commands, lifecycle phases, and agent topology remain hidden from operators.

## [2026-07-17]

### Added
- Added a reusable landing-page copywriting framework for reader-question sequencing, section-role and repetition ledgers, and claim/proof safety, integrated into the existing `009-sg-marketing copywriting` mode without adding a public mode or reusing project-specific copy.

### Changed
- Compacted `205-sg-veille` into a two-mode source-triage dispatcher with bounded qualification and persistence playbooks, explicit research/content/marketing/docs/tracker handoffs, deterministic boundary proof, and aligned public discovery guidance. This records a verified local skill/runtime/documentation migration, not a shipped deployment or a source-triage outcome.
- Formalized `008-sg-customer` as one customer-experience skill with `audit`, `flow`, `onboarding`, and `recovery` modes plus bounded playbooks; aligned active discovery and public documentation without introducing a second customer identity or claiming a shipped product-flow outcome.
- Consolidated the technical skill surface into the new public `010-sg-technical` entrypoint with `audit`, `deps`, `performance`, `migrate`, and `help` modes; migrated active routing, documentation, runtime discovery, catalogs, and public pages; retired `401`-`404` without aliases; and verified the local migration with focused contract tests (14/14), governed metadata (18/18), runtime sync (204/204), and two public builds.
- Consolidated the public repurposing-skill surface into the `repurpose` mode of `007-sg-content`; migrated active routing, runtime, catalog, documentation, and public discovery guidance while retiring the standalone predecessor entrypoint. The skill/runtime/public-documentation migration was verified; this does not claim a production content outcome.

### Fixed
- Reduced DevServer shell startup and environment-picker latency with lazy atomic registry refresh, pruned Flox discovery, parent-shell caches, coherent invalidation, and adaptive pending-input draining; verified medians are `0.13s` for library sourcing, `0.19s` for `s x`, `0.31s` for `s m n`, and `0.58s` for `s m r`, with gum and Bash fallback selection/cancellation proof.

## [2026-07-16]

### Changed
- Consolidated the public marketing-skill surface into `009-sg-marketing` modes for market study, GTM, copy, and copywriting; migrated active routing, runtime, catalog, documentation, and public discovery guidance while retiring the four predecessor entrypoints. The local/runtime/public-surface migration was verified; this does not claim a production marketing outcome.

## [2026-07-15]

### Changed
- Consolidated the public design-skill surface into `006-sg-design` modes and six focused playbooks; migrated active help, runtime, catalog, and public-site guidance while retiring the redundant `409` and `500–504` entrypoints.
- Renamed `008-sg-end-user` to `008-sg-customer` across runtime discovery, routing, catalogs, documentation, and the public skill page to avoid collision with `end` searches.
- Consolidated internal skill maintenance into `900-shipglowz-core` modes and focused build/refresh playbooks; migrated active docs, routes, profiles, catalogs, and runtime discovery while removing the retired `009` and `307` source/runtime entries.

## [2026-07-13]

### Changed
- Moved the seven root Bash regression suites into ownership-based `tests/cli`, `tests/runtime`, `tests/governance`, `tests/skills`, and `tests/workflow` directories, with behavior-based names and canonical `cli/` imports.
- Consolidated active documentation, bug, audit, conversation, exploration, specification, research, and archive records under their canonical `shipglowz_data/` families.
- Flattened the single-child template hierarchy so all 25 artifact templates now live directly under `templates/`.

### Fixed
- Repaired stale logging, Flox override, Flutter session-name, and project-tracking fixtures; all seven relocated suites now pass and `shipglowz_init_project` returns success when initialization is already current.

### Removed
- Removed unconsumed root `docs`, `bugs`, `archive`, `specs`, and `research` surfaces and the two unused root devserver compatibility launchers while preserving canonical content and CLI implementations.

## [2026-07-12]

### Added
- Added an invokable technology-specialist catalog for Neovim, Python, Bash, Astro, TypeScript, JavaScript, Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Convex, Vercel, Sentry, cloud integrations, Turso, and CrewAI while preserving owner-skill routing.
- Added canonical platform notes for TypeScript, JavaScript, Flutter, Dart, Turso, PydanticAI, LangGraph, Cloudflare Workers, Hono, Drizzle ORM, and TanStack Start; future-stack entries remain reference-only until project adoption justifies a role.

## [2026-07-11]

### Changed
- Taught the editorial-governance bootstrap flow to create and report `shipglowz_data/editorial/ROADMAP.md` when a project has applicable public/editorial surfaces, and aligned `300-sg-docs`, `305-sg-init`, and the editorial corpus reference around that same normalization rule.
- Added the optional `#feature:<term>` navigation hint across the routing, help, context, docs-map, and IME behavior-index surfaces so known terms like `swipe` recover the right behavior family before broad search.

## [2026-07-04]

### Added
- Added a shared code-navigation and function-documentation doctrine with a reusable `technical_behavior_index` template and a dedicated verification checklist for term-based recovery.

### Changed
- Extended the technical docs corpus, governance rules, and `300-sg-docs` technical audit so agents can resolve operator terms through behavior indexes, detect navigation bootstrap/drift gaps, and verify comment coverage on high-cognitive-load symbols.
- Added the first WinFlowz IME gesture pilot so `swipe` resolves to named behaviors, mapped Kotlin entrypoints, and linked technical artifacts without repeating the original investigation.

## [2026-06-28]

### Changed
- Added dedicated repo-visible runtime pages for OpenCode and KiloCode, linked them from the core docs surfaces, documented the proven OpenCode shim paths, and made the KiloCode compatibility boundary explicit where the repository does not ship a dedicated shim.
- Clarified public and repo-visible runtime/docs handoffs so help surfaces explain and route, `000-shipflow` routes or answers directly, owner lifecycle/specialist skills own execution after handoff, and OpenCode/KiloCode internal calls such as `skill({ name: "shipflow" })` are not presented as manual operator commands.
- Updated the launch cheatsheet numeric runtime examples to match the canonical three-digit skill naming and aligned README, workflow doctrine, runtime docs, and help catalog wording on invocation versus execution ownership.

## [2026-06-25]

### Added
- Added env registry `~/.shipflow/envs.reg` — built once on lib.sh load (`registry_sync`), updated by `env_start`/`env_stop`, read by dashboard via `cat` (0 subprocesses during render)
- Added auto-install guards in `env_start()` — checks for missing/empty `node_modules` (runs pnpm/npm install), missing Python venv (creates + pip install), unreachable Doppler (disables if offline)
- Added `pm2_health_scan()` — reads `~/.pm2/dump.pm2` (~1ms file read, no subprocess) at lib.sh load and after `env_start` to warn of >10 restart processes
- Added PM2 health to async status cache (`refresh_menu_status_cache_sync`, 120s interval) — displayed in `print_header()` with no menu latency
- Added stdin buffer drain after action bar (`read -t 0.01 -n 10000`) to prevent key leakage to main menu

### Changed
- Migrated all npm projects to pnpm (`dianedefores`, `beatflowz`/`vocal-tract-viewer`, `contentglowz_site`, `contentglowz_remotion_worker`)
- Fixed `detect_dev_command` — removed `--` separator for pnpm (v11 doesn't pass flags through `--`)
- Fixed `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` (esbuild, sharp) via `allowBuilds` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- Redesigned dashboard: numbered `[ 1]...[14]` layout, legend `🟢 online 🟡 stopped 🔴 error ⚪ unknown`, `📊 N Environments :` (count in header), `⚙️ Actions :` split on 2 lines with `[n] [s] [e] [o] [k] [x]` — single-keypress immediate (no Enter for s/k/digits)
- Bulk stop operations now silent (output to `>/dev/null 2>&1`)
- Memoized `resolve_project_path()` — single `find` cached 5s instead of per-call `find` (28→1)
- Simplified port display: `localhost:PORT` (no protocol prefix), fixed double-colon `Port: :3004` → `Port: 3004`
- Added pause between environment list and idle-app picker in dashboard

### Renamed
- PM2/directory/flox env: `app` → `shipflow_app`, `site` → `shipglowz-site`, flox env `contentflowz-app` → `shipflow-app`
- Created `/home/claude/shipflow_app/shipflow_app/` directory for renamed shipflow_app project

### Removed
- Deleted `contentglowz_app` from PM2 (Flutter build — CI only)
- Filtered `pm2-logrotate` out of env registry (no `.flox` dir)

### Fixed
- Fixed `contentglowz_lab` 2355 restarts — created missing Python venv + installed deps, removed broken `doppler run` wrapper from ecosystem config

## [2026-06-19]

### Added
- Added a repo-backed Codex marketplace source at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, a publishable plugin mirror under `plugins/shipflow`, and dedicated public install pages at `/install` and `/fr/install`.

### Changed
- Updated the ShipFlow plugin README, technical packaging docs, docs-links catalog, skill help surfaces, FAQ/docs cross-links, and public `shipflow` skill page so users can install `shipflow` from the repository marketplace path and start with `$shipflow`.

## [2026-06-12]

### Changed
- Clarified the core lifecycle gate skills so `100-sg-spec`, `101-sg-ready`, `103-sg-verify`, `104-sg-end`, and `005-sg-ship` state tighter artifact roles, owner boundaries, and lifecycle semantics without changing their delegated workflow behavior.
- Clarified the source specialist skill family so `105-sg-check`, `106-sg-fix`, `107-sg-test`, `108-sg-browser`, and `109-sg-auth-debug` keep sharper proof, fix, browser, and auth boundaries without changing their underlying routing roles.
- Clarified the maintenance and release master family so `002-sg-maintain`, `003-sg-bug`, and `004-sg-deploy` state explicit `master-workflow` roles and sharper boundaries between project upkeep, one-bug lifecycle execution, and release-confidence orchestration.
- Formalized and closed the Batch D2 semantic-compaction chantier for the design/content/skill-build master family after verifying that `006-sg-design`, `007-sg-content`, and `009-sg-skill-build` match the intended `master-workflow` boundaries.

## [2026-06-11]

### Added
- Added a reusable runtime diagnostics surface reference requiring runtime apps to expose safe copyable diagnostics with commit/build and Paris/UTC build-time headers.

### Changed
- Updated browser, auth-debug, start, verify, init, production, and code-audit skills to favor, use, and verify diagnostics/log-copy surfaces before asking operators for logs.

## [2026-06-10]

### Changed
- Added veille/backlog references for Alpic MCP/ChatGPT Apps distribution, models.dev model metadata, and OpenPostern-style security signal routing as future ShipFlow skill/product directions.
- Added bounded `102-sg-start` local auto-verification semantics so safe, tool-backed, non-destructive proof can run in the same local implementation flow while preview, production, browser/auth, manual QA, commit, push, and ship proof stays routed to owner skills.
- Migrated ShipFlow skill runtime names to three-digit prefixes such as `000-shipflow` and `001-sg-build`, with a canonical `skills/references/skill-code-index.md` map, router/help guidance, validators, synced Codex/Claude runtime links, and manual picker proof.
- Closed the project-aware editorial scoring chantier with sample rubric evidence covering schema-complete scoring plus duplicate, conflicting, and stale score rejection scenarios.
- Documented project-aware editorial scoring across README, launch cheatsheet, help catalog, public skill pages, public mode cheatsheet, and editorial governance gates.
- Hardened ShipFlow conversation audit storage so the `000-shipflow` tmux capture preset stays under `$SHIPFLOW_ROOT/shipglowz_data/workflow/conversations/` and project-local destinations are blocked.
- Hardened human-mode ShipFlow skill reports so directly launched skills return concise operator-facing outcomes while keeping detailed evidence in `report=agent`.
- Strengthened the shared question contract so skills choose safe professional defaults and ask only material numbered questions in plain decision language.
- Tightened proof-first reporting and `101-sg-ready` readiness output with proof-gap language, compact user-mode readiness reports, atomic ready metadata transitions, and a pressure-scenario checklist.
- Added hosted-proof follow-through routing so `partial` verdicts name the proof owner, scenario, target or environment, and deploy-first ladder instead of leaving operators to infer the next skill.

## [2026-06-01]

### Changed
- Clarified the project-aware editorial scoring chantier with a required `Test Contract` and kept closure partial until `103-sg-verify` has sample rubric output evidence.

## [2026-05-30]

### Added
- Added a ShipFlow conversation-audit loop with a `000-shipflow` tmux capture preset, canonical private transcript storage, a new `705-sg-conversation-audit` skill, deterministic fixture classification, and a `conversation_audit` artifact template.
- Added an actionable failure routing contract so support and lifecycle skills can map evidence-backed failures to concrete owner routes instead of passive reports.
- Added a private batch conversation excellence audit report that turns selected `/home/claude` conversation transcripts into evidence-backed skill follow-up routes.

### Changed
- Updated operator discovery docs, help catalog, and the public skill page set to include the conversation-audit workflow.

## [2026-05-29]

### Added
- Added durable manual checklist artifacts for proof-first TDD workflows, including the canonical `shipglowz_data/workflow/test-checklists/<scope>.md` path and parser-backed status handling for `PASS`, `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, `NOT_RUN`, and `N/A`.

### Changed
- Updated `107-sg-test`, README, workflow doctrine, FAQ, and launch-cheatsheet content so operators can fill checklist files directly while agents consume them as evidence instead of relying on chat copy-paste.

## [2026-05-18]

### Added
- Added a shared spec-driven development discipline for ShipFlow: specs, bug files, release scopes, and mini-contracts remain the source of truth while execution chooses a concrete proof path.

### Changed
- Updated `102-sg-start`, `106-sg-fix`, `003-sg-bug`, `009-sg-skill-build`, and `103-sg-verify` to use proof paths such as `test-first`, `regression-first`, `scenario-first`, `evidence-first`, or `exception-with-proof`.
- Updated master lifecycle, delegation, and skill runtime documentation so delegated missions and completion claims carry proof-path evidence instead of relying on unqualified "done" claims.

## [2026-05-17]

### Changed
- Audited the ShipFlow skill taxonomy and compacted 56 skill discovery descriptions, reducing average description length from 70.7 to 51.3 and the absolute discovery estimate from 7988/8000 to 6805/8000 while keeping all skill names, invocation paths, trace categories, and process roles stable.
- Clarified `300-sg-docs` discovery wording to expose governance-layout compliance after a local transcript showed README/docs refresh could miss a layout migration gate.
- Documented the current skill discovery family map in the technical lifecycle notes.

## [2026-05-16]

### Changed
- Compacted the remaining oversized ShipFlow skills above 500 lines into concise activation contracts with skill-local workflow references, reducing `SKILL.md` line-count risks while preserving chantier, reporting, audit, SEO, copywriting, bootstrap, and source-faithfulness guardrails.
- Compacted the next non-lifecycle token-risk skill batch (`400-sg-audit`, `409-sg-audit-a11y`, `206-sg-audit-copy`, `408-sg-audit-gtm`, `109-sg-auth-debug`, `201-sg-enrich`, `204-sg-market-study`, `405-sg-prod`, `200-sg-redact`), leaving only lifecycle skills `100-sg-spec` and `102-sg-start` in the token-risk list.
- Compacted the lifecycle token-risk skills (`100-sg-spec`, `102-sg-start`) into concise activation contracts with skill-local workflow references, bringing the skill budget audit to zero body-size token risks while preserving spec-first, chantier, reporting, and execution-result semantics.
- Documented the phase 2 compaction convention in the skill runtime lifecycle notes.

## [2026-05-14]

### Changed
- `001-sg-build agents` now explicitly validates delegated sequential execution for file work, validation, closure preparation, and ship preparation; parallel agents remain controlled only by ready spec `Execution Batches`.
- `704-sg-model`, `102-sg-start`, and shared master lifecycle references now treat `gpt-5.5` as the Codex/OpenAI premium default for ambiguous, cross-project, governance-heavy, transverse audit, task-prioritization, prompt/docs migration, and business-risk synthesis work.
- Small bounded Codex/OpenAI subagent missions now default to `gpt-5.4-mini`, with `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` reserved for micro-code or targeted UI/local edits.
- `gpt-5.3-codex` is now documented as the Codex/OpenAI default for long implementation, multi-file coding, refactors, hard debugging, and terminal-heavy agentic execution.
- Delegated subagent mission contracts now require model, reasoning or alias behavior, fallback, and model application status when model overrides are available.
- README, workflow doctrine, launch cheatsheet, and technical lifecycle docs now clarify that the main conversation can recommend or route to a better model, but must not claim it can always switch its own active runtime model mid-thread.

## [2026-05-09]

### Added
- The Agents / CI menu now includes a GitHub Login action that checks `gh`
  authentication, launches `gh auth login` when needed, and configures Git
  credentials for deploy-oriented workflows.

### Changed
- Root, server submenus, nested menus, search selectors, and local tunnel
  menus now share a padded ShipFlow DevServer header treatment with consistent
  title colors, borders, and session identity placement.
- The ShipFlow root menu is now grouped into readable entries (`Dashboard`,
  `Deploy / Start`, `Environments`, `Tools`, `System`,
  `Agents`, `ShipFlow`, `Help`, `Exit`) with icons.
- The previous `Agents / ShipFlow` root entry is now split into separate
  `Agents` and `ShipFlow` items, giving the ShipFlow tracker menu its own
  shortcut.
- Environment, tools, system, and agents submenus now show iconed titles,
  a blank spacer, and iconed one-key actions in both Gum and bash frontends.
- CLI one-shot menu keys now match the visible root menu keys instead of
  preserving hidden direct shortcuts.

### Fixed
- The bash fallback no longer highlights action rows just because their label
  contains words such as `CI`.

## [2026-05-08]

### Changed
- The ShipFlow top-level menu now avoids per-item Gum subprocesses and uses a
  two-column layout on wide terminals, with a one-column fallback for narrow
  terminals.
- Codex MCP providers are registered disabled by default and can be launched
  per session from the ShipFlow Codex launcher.
- ShipFlow now manages the local Caddy proxy in user mode with the PM2 app
  lifecycle instead of leaving the system Caddy service as the normal runtime
  path.
- `003-sg-bug` now presents itself as a bug lifecycle executor that continues through owner skills and bounded subagents when safe, instead of a simple next-command router.
- Repo docs, help text, launch cheatsheet, technical lifecycle docs, and public skill pages now use the same `003-sg-bug` lifecycle wording.

### Fixed
- Health, Flutter Web, and Codex submenus now use explicit one-key actions for
  sensitive commands, preventing residual Enter/input from opening cleanup or
  launch actions accidentally.
- Closed `BUG-2026-05-08-001` and `BUG-2026-05-08-002` after focused `107-sg-test`
  retests for menu startup and Health cleanup routing.
- Cleared stale Astro content cache and confirmed the public site builds without the duplicate `003-sg-bug` content id warning.

## [2026-05-06]

### Added
- `006-sg-design` master design lifecycle skill for routing UI/UX, design-token, playground, component, accessibility, browser-proof, implementation, verification, and ship workflows from one design entrypoint.
- Public `006-sg-design` skill page and launch-cheatsheet routing so design-related requests are discoverable from the site and repo docs.

### Changed
- `000-shipflow` routing now sends design-related operator requests to `006-sg-design`.
- Design playground and design-system creation guidance now call out the follow-up migration needed when centralized tokens are not yet consumed across pages and components.

## [2026-05-04]

### Added
- Shared skill reporting contract for concise default user reports (`report=user`) and explicit detailed handoff reports (`report=agent`).
- Public and repo-level skill launch cheatsheet covering master skills, supporting skill lanes, and documented argument modes.
- Public `001-sg-build` skill page so the recommended master build entrypoint appears in the skill catalog.
- Standalone Markdown skill launch cheatsheet under `docs/skill-launch-cheatsheet.md`.

### Changed
- Lifecycle, bug, deploy, skill-build, and audit skills now load the shared reporting contract and use compact chantier/report guidance by default.
- `005-sg-ship` user reports now present outcome, evidence, and limits in order, match the operator's active language, and use sober status emojis for faster scanning.
- Selected OpenAI skill metadata now uses exact invocation keys as display names so the skill picker matches typed skill commands.
- `001-sg-build` Plan Mode questions now frame the root problem, business stakes, options, and best-practice recommendation before asking a business decision.
- `009-sg-skill-build` now routes fuzzy skill ideas or placement uncertainty through `700-sg-explore` before creating a durable `100-sg-spec` contract.
- Docs overview, skills hub, FAQ, content map, workflow doctrine, and editorial maps now route skill-mode questions to the launch cheatsheet instead of a narrow argument tutorial.

### Fixed
- Public site layout now declares a favicon to avoid the browser `favicon.ico` 404 during checks.
- Installer alias refresh now removes stale standalone ShipFlow aliases before writing the managed alias block.
- Install report markdown now escapes the ARM64 Flutter release command example correctly.
- `001-sg-build` now continues through `104-sg-end` and `005-sg-ship` after successful verification instead of handing those lifecycle steps back as manual next commands, unless a concrete blocker requires user input.
- Disk cleanup now escalates root disk pressure with warning/high/critical messages, before/after used percentages, and explicit VM freeze/build-stall guidance.
- Fallback CLI headers now render ANSI colors with `printf` instead of passing escape codes through `sed`, avoiding visible `33[...m` fragments.
- One-key menu input now emits a newline immediately after the keypress so the next screen cannot start on the prompt line.
- Top-level menu shortcut arguments such as `sf u` now dispatch directly to their menu action while preserving action confirmations.
- CLI Back handling now maps `x`, `Esc`, and Backspace through shared helpers and skips the parent pause when returning from nested menus.
- Root menu actions now render through a shared screen-isolation helper so command output starts on a clean screen instead of below the full root menu.
- Shared boxed headers now keep Dashboard, logs, health, and deployment success borders aligned.

## [2026-05-03]

### Added
- `003-sg-bug` professional bug loop orchestrator, public skill page, and runtime visibility links for routing bug intake, dossiers, fixes, retests, verification, and ship risk.
- `004-sg-deploy` release orchestrator skill, public skill page, and runtime visibility links for the `105-sg-check -> 005-sg-ship -> 405-sg-prod -> proof -> 103-sg-verify -> 304-sg-changelog` flow.
- `002-sg-maintain` master maintenance lifecycle, public skill page, and runtime visibility links for carrying maintenance from triage through spec/readiness, delegated fixes, verification, and ship/deploy routing.

### Changed
- README, workflow doctrine, help, technical lifecycle docs, and chantier tracking now present `003-sg-bug` as the bug lifecycle router while preserving `107-sg-test`, `106-sg-fix`, `109-sg-auth-debug`, `108-sg-browser`, `103-sg-verify`, and `005-sg-ship` as phase owners.
- README, workflow doctrine, help, technical lifecycle docs, and chantier tracking now present `004-sg-deploy` as the release lifecycle entrypoint while preserving atomic skills for direct expert use.
- README, workflow doctrine, help, technical lifecycle docs, public skill content, and chantier tracking now present `002-sg-maintain` as a lifecycle master skill instead of a read-only router.
- Several skill descriptions were compacted to keep the ShipFlow skill discovery budget under the hard runtime limit after adding `004-sg-deploy`.

### Fixed
- Closed the current-user runtime skill visibility bug after the active Codex runtime retest showed newly published ShipFlow skills are discoverable.

## [2026-05-02]

### Added
- `001-sg-build` lifecycle skill as the user-facing master orchestrator from story intake through spec/readiness, implementation, verification, closure, and ship handoff.
- Dedicated internal subagent role contracts for technical reading, editorial reading, sequential execution, wave execution, and integration.

### Changed
- README, workflow doctrine, help, and chantier tracking now present `001-sg-build` as the recommended end-user entrypoint while preserving atomic skills for expert control and recovery.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Mode `309-sg-tasks sessions` et playbook reutilisable pour indexer les noms de conversations Codex avec les statuts exacts du tracker local, y compris les forks et reprises de contexte.

- `artifact: bug_record` support in `tools/shipflow_metadata_lint.py`, including bug status, severity, redaction status, reproducibility, and `BUG-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` ID validation
- Dependency-free ShipFlow metadata linter for specs and project decision-contract documents
- Skill-aligned artifact templates for specs, business context, brand context, audits, verification, readiness, review, research, and decision records
- Spec-first chantier registry doctrine: specs now carry `source_model`, `Skill Run History`, and `Current Chantier Flow` so skill runs can be reviewed from the spec without reading chat history
- Shared chantier tracking rules and an all-skills matrix covering mandatory, conditional, and non-applicable spec tracing behavior
- Internal skill taxonomy for chantier intake, including `source-de-chantier` process roles and standard `Chantier potentiel` routing to `/100-sg-spec`
- `303-sg-resume` — fast current-thread recap skill with task status bullets, close/keep-open verdict, and one critical reminder

- Local MCP OAuth helper with guided server IP and optional SSH key configuration for local tunnels and remote Codex MCP login
- Durable `exploration_report` artifacts for `700-sg-explore`, including the reusable template and default `docs/explorations/` report location
- Skill discovery budget audit for ShipFlow skills, with strict checks for one-sentence descriptions, name/path metadata, listing budgets, and separate long-body risks
- `009-sg-skill-build` master skill orchestrating skill lifecycle work (`700-sg-explore` when needed → `100-sg-spec` → SKILL.md → `307-sg-skills-refresh` → budget audit → `103-sg-verify` → `300-sg-docs/help` → `005-sg-ship`) and public catalog coherence updates

### Changed
- Local SSH setup now resolves bare identity filenames from the menu launch directory, `~/.ssh/`, then the user's home directory, and saves the absolute path for later `ssh -i` / `autossh -i` use.
- Local SSH server configuration now rejects invalid free-form hosts before asking for the SSH user, while still accepting valid IPv4 addresses, dotted domains, and exact aliases from `~/.ssh/config`.
- Local menu one-key prompts now print a clean newline after hidden key reads, avoiding glued Termux output such as a prompt followed immediately by the next border.
- README, workflow doctrine, corpus references, and skill lifecycle docs now explain that future projects should use `305-sg-init` and `300-sg-docs` for project-local governance corpora instead of rerunning ShipFlow's shipped governance specs per project.
- README, workflow docs, content map, public docs page, technical docs, and content-focused skills now route public-content work through the editorial governance layer before strengthening public claims or editing Astro runtime content
- Agent and workflow docs now route code-changing work through `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md` and require a `Documentation Update Plan` for mapped code changes
- Ready specs with missing confidence or draft-style versions were normalized so the default ShipFlow metadata lint baseline passes again
- `102-sg-start`, `106-sg-fix`, `109-sg-auth-debug`, `107-sg-test`, `103-sg-verify`, `105-sg-check`, `104-sg-end`, `005-sg-ship`, and `405-sg-prod` now distinguish local evidence from Vercel preview-push evidence and route through `005-sg-ship` -> `405-sg-prod` when remote validation is required
- Local tunnel tools now share SSH validation and remote PM2 port parsing through `local/remote-helpers.sh` to reduce drift between `local/local.sh`, `local/dev-tunnel.sh`, and `local/mcp-login.sh`
- `700-sg-explore`, workflow docs, help docs, and public skill docs now explain when substantial explorations create or update durable reports without writing chantier spec history
- Codex TUI defaults now show remaining context with `context-remaining` and rate-limit status with `five-hour-limit` plus `weekly-limit`.
- `107-sg-test`, `106-sg-fix`, `103-sg-verify`, `005-sg-ship`, `300-sg-docs`, and `302-sg-help` now share the same bug lifecycle, retest, evidence-redaction, and bug-gate rules
- README, workflow docs, `107-sg-test` README, and public skill pages now describe the compact index plus detailed bug dossier model instead of treating `BUGS.md` as the full bug record
- Existing Codex TUI spec migrated to the ShipFlow metadata frontmatter schema
- `100-sg-spec`, `101-sg-ready`, `102-sg-start`, `103-sg-verify`, `104-sg-end`, and `005-sg-ship` now report chantier status and trace lifecycle results when a unique spec-first chantier is identified
- Workflow documentation now links metadata doctrine to executable templates and linting
- `106-sg-fix`, `102-sg-start`, `103-sg-verify`, and `405-sg-prod` now route auth/browser-flow uncertainty through `109-sg-auth-debug` when browser evidence is needed
- `102-sg-start`, `106-sg-fix`, `105-sg-check`, `107-sg-test`, `405-sg-prod`, and `103-sg-verify` now route non-auth browser evidence through `108-sg-browser` instead of stretching `109-sg-auth-debug`
- Public skill pages, the skills hub, and the FAQ now explain when to use `108-sg-browser` versus `109-sg-auth-debug`, `107-sg-test`, and `405-sg-prod`
- Internal README docs and the public category plus chantier taxonomy specs now keep `108-sg-browser` aligned as a 49-page `Build & Fix` public skill and `source-de-chantier` process source
- Playwright MCP setup now prefers local Playwright Chromium or Chromium fallback over Google Chrome stable on Linux ARM64, with a shared runtime preflight reference for browser-evidence skills
- `106-sg-fix` now requires durable bug memory for direct fixes by creating or reusing a `BUG-ID` and per-bug dossier unless a narrow minor exception is explicitly justified
- Internal and public skill documentation now explain when to use `109-sg-auth-debug` and which auth references it carries
- Internal linking across the public site now routes homepage, docs, about, and "Why not just prompts?" traffic toward the new skill-modes tutorial and FAQ surfaces
- ShipFlow installer now targets selected eligible user accounts for AI configuration instead of mutating every `/home/*` account by default
- ShipFlow installer now owns Claude/Codex autonomous defaults, AI aliases (`c`, `co`, `cask`, `coask`), and per-user npm bootstrap for selected users
- Dotfiles installer now delegates Claude/Codex install and client MCP mutation to ShipFlow, and keeps only shared MCP registry linking
- CLI fallback choice parsing now normalizes uppercase input, trailing `)`, whitespace, and carriage returns so letter-based deploy and submenu prompts accept the expected keys more reliably
- ShipFlow CLI menus and submenus now use instant letter shortcuts consistently, with one-key confirmations and pauses while preserving text-entry and FZF/gum-filter flows.
- Local SSH setup prompts now explain default values explicitly and save custom identity-file paths as stable absolute paths before using `ssh -i` / `autossh -i`.
- Local tunnel startup now shows a polished animated SSH sonar scan while the menu checks the remote server, with `SHIPFLOW_NO_ANIMATION=1` as an opt-out for automated or slow terminals.
- All current skill descriptions were compacted for Codex and Claude Code discovery: the strict audit now reports 49 skills, 0 hard violations, 0 warnings, a 7230-character absolute estimate, and an 88.4-character average description length
- `300-sg-docs` and `307-sg-skills-refresh` now run the skill budget audit only when work touches skills, discovery wording, `agents/openai.yaml`, or Codex/Claude Code skill compatibility

### Security
- Replaced the operator server IP in SSH examples and recent branch history with documentation-only example addresses.
- Added root autonomous-mode guard in ShipFlow installer: autonomous Claude/Codex permissions on root now require explicit opt-in (`SHIPFLOW_AI_ALLOW_ROOT_AUTONOMOUS=1`)
- Added eligibility filtering before user AI mutation (non-root, real login shell, writable resolved home) to reduce accidental config writes on service/system accounts

### Removed
- Removed dotfiles-side Claude/Codex ownership actions (CLI install path, Codex config symlink ownership, and direct Claude/Codex client MCP mutation)

## [2026-04-25] - Contract metadata versioning across skills

### Added
- `101-sg-ready` — new readiness gate for specs before implementation, with explicit user-story alignment, adversarial review, workflow bypass checks, documentation coherence, and proportional cybersecurity review
- Standard artifact versioning rules for ShipFlow documentation: `metadata_schema_version` for the metadata contract and `artifact_version` for the document's decision content
- Versioned dependency tracking through `depends_on`, `required_status`, `next_review`, and `supersedes` so specs can declare which business and technical contracts they were built against
- Active documentation-coherence checks across implementation, verification, audit, docs, business-content, and shipping skills

### Changed
- `100-sg-spec`, `101-sg-ready`, `102-sg-start`, `103-sg-verify`, `104-sg-end`, `300-sg-docs`, and business/documentation-generating skills now treat business docs as versioned decision contracts, not passive context
- Audit skills now apply stronger product-coherence, user-story, documentation-drift, and security-risk scrutiny instead of limiting review to their narrow domain
- `103-sg-verify` now checks whether work was implemented against current docs, outdated docs, unknown dependency versions, or non-applicable contracts
- `005-sg-ship` now reports evidence limits explicitly and avoids claiming product, user-story, documentation, or security completion from commit/push alone

## [2026-04-25] - ShipFlow artifact and business-documentation doctrine

### Added
- `README.md` now frames ShipFlow as a professional work framework built around decision contracts, not just a collection of skills
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md` now documents the artifact doctrine, standard metadata frontmatter, business docs as decision contracts, documentation coherence, and adoption/migration rules
- Business documentation (`BUSINESS.md`, `BRANDING.md`, personas, pricing, positioning, GTM docs) is now documented as technical decision infrastructure because it drives implementation, audits, shipping, and public claims

### Changed
- ShipFlow internal artifacts are now expected to use standardized metadata for status, confidence, risk, security impact, documentation impact, evidence, linked systems, and next step
- Documentation coherence is now described as part of feature completeness when product behavior, setup, permissions, API usage, pricing, onboarding, or support expectations change

## [2026-04-25] - Codex TUI defaults during install

### Changed
- `install.sh` now configures Codex TUI defaults for each user (`root` + `/home/*`) by writing a ShipFlow-managed block in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Added idempotent TOML upsert behavior for `tui.status_line` and `tui.terminal_title` while preserving user configuration outside the managed block

### Documentation
- `README.md` now documents the Codex TUI defaults, interactive fallback commands (`/statusline`, `/title`), and the current Codex customization boundary

## [2026-04-24] - Model routing and multi-agent execution topology

### Added
- `704-sg-model` — new skill to choose between `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, and `gpt-5.2` based on task profile, cost, latency, and execution risk
- `skills/704-sg-model/references/model-routing.md` — shared routing matrix so model-selection guidance can be reused consistently across ShipFlow skills

### Changed
- `102-sg-start` now chooses an execution topology (`single-agent` vs `multi-agent`) before implementation, with explicit file ownership, group boundaries, and integration responsibility
- `102-sg-start` now reads the shared `704-sg-model` routing reference, selects a primary execution model and reasoning effort, and can assign per-group model overrides for multi-agent runs

## [2026-04-23] - One-pass workflow docs and fresh-context policy

### Changed
- `README.md` now states the one-pass execution model explicitly: complete context before coding, no hidden dependency on chat history, and fresh-context escalation when needed
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md` now documents that `101-sg-ready` and `102-sg-start` are the main points where a fresh context may be enforced for non-trivial execution
- The workflow docs now treat prompt-and-correct as a bounded fallback, not the default operating mode
- `CHANGELOG.md` records the fresh-context policy so the workflow shift is visible outside the skills themselves

## [2026-04-22] - Spec-driven workflow v3 and documentation cleanup

### Added
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/playbooks/spec-driven-workflow.md` — living documentation for the ShipFlow V3 spec-driven workflow, including `700-sg-explore`, `100-sg-spec`, `101-sg-ready`, `102-sg-start`, `103-sg-verify`, and `104-sg-end`
- `archive/reports/README.md` and `archive/notes/README.md` — archive indexes for historical reports and obsolete notes

### Changed
- `100-sg-spec`, `102-sg-start`, `101-sg-ready`, and `103-sg-verify` aligned around a stricter spec-driven execution model with `103-sg-verify` now able to classify, reroute, and remediate bounded gaps
- Root documentation trimmed to living docs only; historical reports and obsolete notes moved out of the repository root into `archive/`
- `README.md` rewritten to reflect the current ShipFlow architecture, core docs, and the V3 workflow
- `archive/README.md` updated to distinguish living documentation from historical artifacts

## [2026-04-20] - Code audit: anti-duplication & convention drift

- `201-sg-enrich`: internal linking expanded to topic cluster structure (pillar + 2-5 spokes); primary source preference added

## [2026-04-14] - No local builds in ship/verify flows

### Changed
- `005-sg-ship`: Step 6 pre-checks now run typecheck + lint only — `npm run build` removed (build runs in CI/Vercel at push)
- `103-sg-verify`: Step 7 technical checks replaces Build with Typecheck; explicit note to use `/105-sg-check` if a local build is really needed
- Both skills now document why local builds are forbidden, so future edits don't reintroduce them

## [2026-01-24] - Security & Robustness Improvements

### ✅ Priority 1 Tasks Completed

#### 🛡️ Input Validation (Issue #3)
Added comprehensive input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities:

**New Functions in `lib.sh`:**
- `validate_project_path()` - Validates file paths before use
  - Blocks path traversal attacks (`..` sequences)
  - Restricts to safe directories (`/root`, `/home`, `/opt`)
  - Prevents injection attacks (blocks `;`, `&`, `|`, `$`, backticks)
  - Ensures paths are absolute and exist

- `validate_env_name()` - Validates environment names
  - Allows only alphanumeric, dash, underscore, dot
  - Prevents names starting with dash or dot

- `validate_repo_name()` - Validates GitHub repository names
  - Ensures proper GitHub naming conventions
  - Prevents injection attacks

**Updated Functions:**
- `env_start()` - Now validates identifiers before processing

  - **Critical tools:** `pm2`, `node` (must be installed)
  - **Optional tools:** `flox`, `git`, `python3` (warnings only)
  - Provides installation instructions on failure

**Updated Functions:**
- `init_flox_env()` - Now checks for `flox` before attempting to use it

**Menu Integration:**
- `menu.sh` - Runs prerequisite check on startup (line 18)
- `menu_simple_color.sh` - Runs prerequisite check on startup (line 48)

#### 🔒 SSH Tunnel Security
Added input validation to `local/dev-tunnel.sh`:
- Validates `REMOTE_HOST` format

Created `config.sh` with centralized settings:
- Port ranges, SSH settings, logging config
- Tool requirements, validation patterns
- All magic numbers now configurable via environment variables
- Helper functions for config validation

**Integration:**
- `lib.sh` - Sources config.sh and uses all values
- `local/dev-tunnel.sh` - Uses SSH config values
- All scripts now respect centralized configuration

#### 📊 Task #7: Structured Logging (COMPLETED)
Implemented comprehensive logging system:
- **Log levels:** DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
- **Log file:** `/var/log/shipflow/shipflow.log` (configurable)
- **Log rotation:** Automatic rotation at 10MB, 30-day retention
- **Format:** `[TIMESTAMP] [LEVEL] message`

**Integration:**

- Key operations (env_start, env_stop, env_remove) log actions
- Flox initialization logs progress

**Testing:** 15/15 logging tests passed

#### ⚡ Task #5: PM2 Data Caching (COMPLETED)
Optimized PM2 operations with intelligent caching:
- **Performance:** 32x faster (231ms → 7ms)
- **Cache TTL:** 5 seconds (configurable)
- **Auto-invalidation:** Cache cleared after PM2 state changes

### 🔜 Next Steps (Priority 3)

---

### 🤝 Contributing

When making changes:
1. Always validate syntax with `bash -n <script>`
2. Test validation functions with edge cases
3. Update this changelog
4. Update IMPROVEMENTS.md if new issues are discovered

### ✅ Priority 3 Completed (2026-01-24)

All four Priority 3 tasks have been implemented:

#### 🚀 Task #9: jq over Python (COMPLETED)
Optimized JSON parsing with jq preference:
- **New feature:** Automatic jq detection and preference
- **Fallback:** Python3 if jq not available
- **Performance:** 2-5x faster JSON parsing with jq
- **Configuration:** SHIPFLOW_PREFER_JQ (default: true)

**Functions Updated:**
- `get_pm2_data_cached()` - Uses jq if available

**Benefits:**
- Faster PM2 operations
- Lower memory footprint
- Optional dependency (graceful fallback)

**Testing:** 4/4 jq tests (skipped if jq not installed)

#### 🛡️ Task #10: Comprehensive Error Handling (COMPLETED)
Implemented structured error handling system:
- **Error traps:** Automatic error catching with line numbers
- **Temp file cleanup:** Automatic cleanup on exit via traps
- **Configuration:** SHIPFLOW_ERROR_TRAPS, SHIPFLOW_STRICT_MODE

**New Features:**
- `error_trap_handler()` - Logs errors with line numbers
- `cleanup_temp_files()` - Automatic cleanup on exit
- `register_temp_file()` - Register files for cleanup
- Optional strict mode (set -euo pipefail)

**Benefits:**
- Easier debugging (know exact failure line)
- No leaked temporary files
- Production-safe error handling
- Configurable strictness

**Testing:** 5/5 error handling tests ✅

#### ⚡ Task #11: Fix Race Conditions (COMPLETED)
Eliminated race conditions with atomic operations:
- **PM2 operations:** All now idempotent (safe to retry)
- **Port finding:** Double-check verification
- **Process cleanup:** Delay after kill for port release

**Functions Fixed:**
- `env_start()` - Idempotent cleanup (no check-then-act)
- `env_stop()` - Idempotent stop operation  
- `env_remove()` - Idempotent delete operation
- `find_available_port()` - Double-check before returning

**Before:**
```bash
if pm2 list | grep -q "app"; then  # Race condition!
    pm2 delete "app"
fi
```

**After:**
```bash
pm2 delete "app" 2>/dev/null || true  # Idempotent, no race
```

**Benefits:**
- No race conditions
- Safe retry logic
- More reliable operations
- Cleaner code

**Testing:** 5/5 race condition tests ✅

#### 📚 Task #12: Function Documentation (COMPLETED)
Added comprehensive inline documentation:
- **16+ functions** fully documented
- **Consistent format:** Description, Arguments, Returns, Examples
- **400+ lines** of documentation

**Documentation Standard:**
```bash
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# function_name - Brief description
#
# Description:
#   Detailed explanation...
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 - Parameter description
#
# Returns:
#   0 - Success
#   1 - Error
#
# Example:
#   function_name "arg"
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**Documented Functions:**
- Validation: validate_project_path, validate_env_name, check_prerequisites
- PM2 & Cache: get_pm2_data_cached, invalidate_pm2_cache, get_pm2_app_data
- Ports: is_port_in_use, find_available_port
- Lifecycle: env_start, env_stop, env_remove
- Utilities: resolve_project_path, parse_json, and more

**Benefits:**
- Self-documenting code
- Clear expectations
- Easy onboarding
- Usage examples included

**Testing:** 16/16 documentation tests ✅
